A thorough cosmetic inspection before returning your leased **2022 Kia Seltos** can help avoid unexpected fees and ensure a smooth return process. Below is a **detailed checklist** covering the key cosmetic areas to inspect.

---

**1. Exterior Body Condition**

✅ **What to Check:**

• **Dents & Dings:** Inspect all body panels for dents or dings larger than **2 inches** (often considered excessive wear).
• **Scratches & Paint Damage:** Check for scratches that penetrate the **clear coat** and expose the primer or metal. Light surface scratches are usually acceptable.
• **Rust or Corrosion:** Inspect door edges, wheel wells, and underbody for any signs of rust or corrosion.
• **Bumper Condition:** Look for scuffs, cracks, or impact damage, especially on lower bumper areas.

**🔹 Why It Matters:** Excessive body damage can lead to costly repair charges at the end of the lease.

**2. Interior Upholstery and Surfaces**

✅ **What to Check:**
• **Seats & Upholstery:** Look for **tears, stains, burns, or excessive wear** on cloth or synthetic leather surfaces. Minor wear is expected, but significant damage may result in penalties.
• **Dashboard & Trim Panels:** Check for **scratches, cracks, or peeling** on the dashboard, center console, and door panels.
• **Floor Mats & Carpeting:** Inspect for deep stains, rips, or missing mats. A professional cleaning may help restore appearance.
• **Odors & Smoke Damage:** Unpleasant odors (e.g., smoke, pet smells) can lead to additional cleaning fees.

**3. Wheels and Tires**

✅ **What to Check:**
• **Wheel Rims:** Check for **curb rash, deep scratches, dents, or missing hubcaps.** Minor scuffs are typically fine, but bent rims can result in costly charges.
• **Tire Condition & Tread Depth:** Lease agreements usually require a **minimum tread depth of 4/32 inches.** Uneven wear may indicate an alignment issue.
• **Sidewall Damage:** Look for **cuts, bubbles, or excessive wear** on the tire sidewalls, which may require replacement before returning the vehicle.

**🔹 Why It Matters:** Worn-out or damaged wheels and tires can result in additional lease-end charges for replacements.

**4. Lights and Mirrors**

✅ **What to Check:**
• **Headlights & Taillights:** Ensure all lights function properly. Look for **cracks, fogging, or water condensation** inside the housings.
• **Turn Signals & Brake Lights:** Verify they illuminate properly—burned-out bulbs should be replaced.
• **Side Mirrors:** Check for **cracks, deep scratches, or broken adjustability.** Scuffs can often be buffed out.

**🔹 Why It Matters:** Functional and undamaged lights and mirrors are crucial for safety and compliance with lease return standards.

**5. Trim and Moldings**

✅ **What to Check:**
• **Door & Window Trim:** Inspect for **cracks, fading, or peeling rubber seals.**
• **Roof Rails (if equipped):** Look for any missing parts, scratches, or dents.
• **Badging & Emblems:** Ensure they are intact and free from peeling or fading.

**🔹 Why It Matters:** Well-maintained trim and moldings improve the vehicle’s resale value and prevent unnecessary deductions.

**6. Windshield and Windows**

✅ **What to Check:**
• **Cracks & Chips:** Even **small chips** can spread, leading to costly replacement fees. Address any damage before the lease return.
• **Tint Condition (if applicable):** Factory-installed tints should be free of peeling, bubbling, or discoloration.
