Key areas to cover in a daily check-in: 

- **Positive aspects:** What did you appreciate about the day/relationship? 
- **Emotional state:** How are you feeling today? 
- **Needs and support:** What could I do to better support you? 
- **Communication:** Is there anything you'd like to talk about? 
- **Quality time:** Do you feel like we've spent enough quality time together? 

Important points to remember: 

- **Be open and honest:** Encourage your partner to share their thoughts and feelings openly. 
- **Active listening:** Pay full attention to what your partner is saying. 
- **Express appreciation:** Let your partner know what you value about them. 
- **Focus on solutions:** If issues arise, work together to find constructive solutions.
## Remember to practice your communication skills to build intimacy

Believe it or not, this type of dialogue creates emotional connection, which is the bedrock of intimacy. However, not all dialogue is equal. Here are a few tips adapted from the Prepare-Enrich program to get the most out of your daily check-in:

1. Give full attention to your partner when they’re talking. Turn off the phone, shut off the television, and make eye contact.
    
2. Focus on the good qualities in each other and complement or appreciate each other throughout the conversation.
    
3. Be assertive rather than passive. Share your thoughts, feelings, and needs. A good way to be assertive without being critical is to use “I” rather than “You” statements. (e.g. “I worry when you don’t let me know you’ll be late” rather than “You are always late”).
    
4. Listen to understand, not to judge, defend, or persuade.
    
5. Use active listening. Summarize your partner’s comments and dig deeper before sharing your own reactions or feelings.
    
6. If a problem arises, avoid blaming each other. Instead, work together to build understanding and explore a solution. If you aren’t able to resolve issues, reach out before they become more serious.
    

As you can see, having daily check-ins is a really effective way to build key relationship skills over time. A true relationship nerd like you wouldn’t be able to resist! ;)
