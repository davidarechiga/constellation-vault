# 08-24-2023 Camille’s outrage

Camille Anne Fulmore:
	There’s a lot I need to say but I don’t feel comfortable really saying things out loud so I’m going to write you a letter. I just can’t go on like this his for the rest of my life David.
	I’m sorry
	When I sit down to start thinking about my vows, I just can’t
	There’s just too much else on my mind I can’t get past and keep ignoring anymore
	
At this point, I’m just empty.
	And really don’t know what I’m waiting for  l anymore
	If this is what your best is than it’s just not for me.
	It’s just so obvious you’re not willing to try and I can’t keep up with your false promises anymore
	I can’t
	It’s not fair anymore for you to keep asking me to be patient up until our wedding day
	If not now. Then when
	What am I committing to
	You couldn’t even dance with me when people are hitting on me when we’re out.
	I don’t feel safe
	No one could even tell we were together
	I hardly can either anymore

David Arechiga:
	Ok. I have felt resentment and contempt from you (especially when you are overwhelm by other parts of your life) for a long time, which makes it hard for me to open up. I find it hard to ask you questions even as simple as “what time are you going into lab today?” When you say you don’t want to be with a sober person, it makes me feel like I’m going through my struggles alone. As much as I try to give you your every need emotionally and physically, I am exhausted and also feeling empty.

Camille Anne Fulmore:
	You’ll never fight for me or this relationship. We’re not the same.
	When do you try
	I do have a lot of resentment for you

David Arechiga:
	When you call me fake, it makes me think of how you act with your friends and then how you turn around and treat me

Camille Anne Fulmore:
	What context did I call you fake? 
	My friends stand up for me more than you
	Literally it reminded me of Marco when we were in the club
	It’s one thing to let someone compliment me, but it’s another that you show nothing  in response to that
	You don’t follow through with commitments you make to me, that’s fake and lying to me. You make promises you don’t keep. My friends don’t do that.
	And neither do I

David Arechiga:
	Ok

Camille Anne Fulmore:
	My friends aren’t insecure and project that on me. I’m often h the one at the receiving end of your insecurities. I often talk to my friends the same way as you but they have thicker skin
	And don’t take things as a personal attack
	When I say I don’t want to be with a sober person, I’m sorry you take that personally but it’s not personal if I’ve felt that way before I met you.
	I want to share my lifestyle with my partner and I’m allowed to have that preference.
	You also said you weren’t gonna smoke weed as long as I wasn’t but that literally didn’t last a day. 
	But Idgaf. I can be strong on my own and I’m not throwing it in your face that you’re not supportive of me. 
	Living a sober life to me means not drinking, doing psychedelics, or smoking weed for the rest of your life. Being straight edge. And that shit is boring to me. I don’t have sober friends. Because I don’t really have much in common with people like that. I get it if you don’t want do that all the time or on special occasions, and I will be supportive to that. But if I’m not even friends with sober people, what makes you think it’s fair for me to want a sober husband 
	Stop making it about just you and being supportive. This is a huge reason why I left Sean is because I couldn’t share a large part of my life with him anymore and didn’t really feel I ever could. 
	I wanna go to things like LDP for the next 20 years and be there with my husband. I don’t want it yo be like Meghan bringing John. We literally said we couldn’t ever even invite him there. 
	And you’re asking me to be okay with that and we’ve literally talked multiple times about how they’re not right together 
	Wake up
	I like drugs in moderation and I love sex. I like to have a nice cocktail when I’m out every now and then but I’m not really a big drinker. But you can’t even commit to being a more sexually open person and that’s actually huge for me. You just want to keep taking away commonality in this relationship but I’m telling you that I’m actually running out of ways to even relate to you
	We’ve had intercourse maybe twice this month. I literally have no seratonin or oxytocin or dopamine being released in my body to counter these feelings or make me feel connected. Why would I be supportive of this sober journey when you haven’t been committed to a sexual
One with me for the past 6 years
	You want to have your cake and eat it too.
	You don’t understand that in order to receive, you also need to give. 
	And that’s why it will never stop feeling so obvious this is your first relationshipZ
	You had to fend for yourself a lot on your own and it shows. Just like I’m sure it shows for me that I have been able to rely and depend on others. I’ve been trying to meet you in the middle for a long time but I can’t really pinpoint where you’ve been trying to commit to intimacy. It’s still mostly me. You asked for independence and to be left alone which I mostly do and try not to bother you and respect your time for creativity or downtime. 
	That’s just an unrealistic expectation, especially when you aren’t willing to step outside your comfort zone and fulfill my needs of intimacy and affection. That’s one sided and selfish. Why would I be incredibly supportive of this newfound journey for you when you haven’t been supportive of my sexual journey/needs for the past 6.
	You want me to be supportive of this sober journey when I actually don’t even know why tf you’re on it. You just expect blind acceptance. And that’s unfair to ask of someone. I’ve spent. Lot of time telling you why instead intimacy and sexuality is important to me in a relationship (and there are hundreds of books and research on this as well so it’s not just a me thing.)
	I’m sorry, I don’t want it to be like how it is when Meghan brings John to a party for me in the future. And if I’m going to parties alone, then why am I married? Soo my husband can sit at home and wait for me just to not even have sex when I get back
	I want to share experiences in life with my husband and you choosing to be sober is even more lonely if a life than I already feel I have
	So we can go to the movies and concerts together? I have lab mates for that. 
	Do you understand?
	I don’t have much in common with how sober people want to live their life and I have a right to not want that in a marriage when I don’t even have that amongst my friends except for maybe random people in my cohort I stop by their house to play a board game but even people like Mari aren’t sober. 
	I think people who are willing to explore their psyche deeper are aignificantly more interesting and risk takers which is what I’m drawn and attracted to. I’ve never wanted to date a sober person in my life. I don’t want to be with someone afraid of everything, including themselves.
	If you were sober when we met, I never would have entertained the idea of dating you.
	That’s with anyone
	If someone I work with doesn’t smoke weed, I likely am not ever going out of my way to hang out with them unless it’s at a group function.
	To me, it’s like you saying suddenly that you don’t want to have intercourse anymore or you’re changing your sexuality, or you want to become Mormon or something equally extreme regarding your identity…..and then being like, omg you don’t want to be supportive of my new lifestyle anymore, I don’t understand how that could be, you’re so unsupportive. Like no….I have preferences regarding who I want to spend the rest of my life with. 
	And that’s actually valid. 
	I’ve been moving at your pace sexually for the last 6 years. Because I really love you and trust that we can grow in that way together. But things are almost regressing in that capacity with us and I am losing trust and faith in You/US because so many false promises and commitments have been made over the years in a realm that is so sacred to me. If you don’t want to be called fake, then you have to commit and follow through with your word. Every false claim relinquishes your credibility as a man and partner.
	It’s becoming evident to me that you hold yourself and comfortability above all and idk if you can become the other half of us that I so desperately need. 
	You want all these things and support but where has mine been over the years
	Yes you’ve grown to become more helpful but what else
	Idk
	You’re literally throwing it back in my face th at I was triggered when you asked me about lab when you know how much I’m struggling even showing up and how deep my imposter syndrome runs. When I already opened up to you how hard it’s been
	I don’t think you’re strong enough for me 
	Especially during the most challenging part of my life as I’m becoming a Doctor
	In an environment where I feel extremely isolated 
	You make it about you
	And you always will
	You can’t relate to what it’s like to put your life through the gauntlet like I have. You don’t push through hard things in the same way I have done my whole life
	I’ve had to rebuild and reinvent my life so many times
	As a white man, it feels you are insensitive to actually comprehending what that experience is like. I’ve never felt silenced by a partner until I was with you. It feels like you’re so afraid of yourself and you want me to be like that too. 
	Like it’d be easier for you if I was
	If you’re constantly concerned with how I act around my friends, maybe it’d be the same if you acted more like them. But my friends are blowing up their insecurities on me and they follow through when they say they will do something. I’m not really friends with Dayna anymore because it was always about taking things personally and not being able to rely on her and her projecting her insecurities. My friends are confident and dependable and thoughtful and sweet. And emotionally supportive and don’t take it personally when I’m
Having a bad day or hard time. 
	You’ve literally met them. 
	You can’t keep acting like you’re surprised that my behavior is different around d them versus my life partner who rarely follows through on their word and has not made a game plan or effort to fulfill my needs for the past 6 years
	You are acting totally unaccountable and basically gas lighting me.
	I’m just over you playing the victim when your effort has not changed. 
	Your points would be more of a valid conversation if you had  consistent patterns or trends of effort but you expect me to remember one off events that happened months ago and hold those dear to my emotional heart as something to rely on
	And forget every false promise you’ve ever made to connect on a deeper level. Every calendar event you e put in that never happens. Every promise to plan more things for us to connect that happens maybe every 3 months. And the. Have the audacity to tell me I’m not supportive. That’s incredibly unfair and shows a lack of self awareness
	Severe lack of self awareness
	Great you’re cleaning up more and helping around the house but literally if I had a shitty roommate that’d be a nice improvement to make living together more tolerable and easy. I need more than that from a lover/partner/fiancé 
	Maybe I’d be more willing to live with them again and renew a lease. You want me to treat you differently than my friends but you need to act like more than one.
	Like you asked to lick my nipple as I’m washing my face. I’m not in middle school and I want a mature sexual relationship with my husband.

David Arechiga:
	Ok, it sounds like I’m not the one for you

Camille Anne Fulmore:
	No surprise this is your response. I know you do t really like to persevere.

David Arechiga:
	What do you want me to say to this avalanche of resentment and contempt?
	It doesn’t matter what I say. It doesn’t matter what I do, it doesn’t matter how hard I try. It just isn’t working for us

Camille Anne Fulmore:
	Idk, maybe actually follow through with anything you’ve said. 

David Arechiga:
	We are different people who want different people
	I have tried time and time again to persevere with you

Camille Anne Fulmore:
	It’s not about just saying things, it’s about actually doing.
	How?
	Rolling over in bed? 

David Arechiga:
	I can’t give you all the sex that you require

Camille Anne Fulmore:
	I have literally asked for sex at least 3 times a week which is something you said you wanted too

David Arechiga:
	my stomach hurts thinking about what kind of response I get from you for asking simple questions 

Camille Anne Fulmore:
	But if that’s what you can’t do in order to make us work then you’re right. You don’t really love me that much and it’s not worth it to keep trying ZZ 

David Arechiga:
	I know and sometimes I am able to give it to you 3 times but sometimes I can’t

Camille Anne Fulmore:
	It’s not just that it’s any intimacy

David Arechiga:
	Ok

Camille Anne Fulmore:
	I’ve told you how it may be better to phrase things to me that would help me with having greater sensitivity but you can’t commit to that either. And your constant fear isn’t solely about me. 

David Arechiga:
	We just don’t really see each other 

Camille Anne Fulmore:
	You’ve been afraid of things and afraid to ask people questions before you met me

David Arechiga:
	Not really like I am afraid with you
	You actually don’t know what Inwas like before you

Camille Anne Fulmore:
	You literally don’t know what’s going on with your sister and her life David
	That I know now
	But you’re right, we can never really be close if you’re in constant fear and not my protector
	You are not willing to fight for me or us in the same capacity I have been.
	That was evident at th club, when we were on ecstasy and you abandoned me, and wh n you commit to intimacy that never happens and you just forget about it.
	Or act like it’s not important 
	You literally fed me false promises and lies again last night and here you are.
	This is just showing that it was never real
	One day passes and you now are saying that you can’t do any more and I don’t understand you and you want a different person
	At least Sean fought for me till the very end.
	I know now what you believe is worth fighting for.
	And it’s not me.
	Or us.
	That’s all I needed to know. 
	I need someone to assure me I’m all they’ll every want and need. But the month before our wedding you’re telling me you want a whole different person. Don’t speak for me and say we because I never have said that.
	Yes I can acknowledge we’re different but I can also take the time to be explicit in expressing my needs. I’m actually taking the time to say all this because I actually care. 
	Your coldness, short responses, and lack of commitment to us makes me sad in ways I cannot even express in words.
	My heart is shattering into pieces and I need a safe place to rebuild. Please stay somewhere else tonight.
	I cannot be around a stranger 
	If I’m truly as scary as you claim me to be, then idk what you’re doing. I show you copious Amounts of love David and for you to tell me how afraid of me you are all the time just because i may be stressed or short with you actually isn’t supportive of me or my situation at all.
	My husband would never tell me he wants a different person 

David Arechiga:
	I have also showed you plenty of unconditional love and support in your tough times, only to make my struggles about you and how you can’t be with someone with my kind of struggles

Camille Anne Fulmore:
	I may tell you traits im attracted to and needs I have but I’ve never wished it wasn’t youZ
	You’re not taking any time to
Work on yourself
	I’ve been going to therapy every week for the past year to try 
	You buy these books of relationships and intimacy that collect dust
	Or work through these struggles you’ve been having. 
	What kind of struggles are you talking about?
	That I’ve made about myself?
	For me to express my need in desperation and intimacy, just for you to respond with your concerns is not fair
	You can’t just bring up how happy you are in response to something so serious for me and turn it into me mistreating you
	If it was that serious for you, you would’ve brought it up on your own
	This retaliatory behaviors is so manipulative 
	And just firther shows me your lack of commitment t to us or this relationship 
	“Sounds like there’s just too much resentment built up so I’m out. I also feel scared when asking you questions. I just want a different person”
	And you wonder why I don’t feel secure or safe with you
	You will always abandon me and us.
	You literally couldn’t go one month with me not smoking weed so fuck you for gaslighting me and telling me I make you go through struggles alone
	What’s worse? 
	You promising me you would and then waking into the other room at night to smoke and hot box the car with our friends while I sit inside? 
	Then continuing to gaslight me that im not supportive of your sobriety whenim actually the one not smoking as you continue? 
	You want everything g when it’s convenient. That is so fucked up. 
	Or is it worse that I’m honest with you in the reasons I wouldn’t want to date someone sober? And sticking by my word?
	You need to understand the extent of how manipulative and retaliatory that is.
	It is actually crazy to me you cannot see the selfishness in this
	Like I said, I was not going to say anything about it because you can do you and I’ll do me and im strong enough to stand alone. I can even make jokes with you about kissing you after youve smoked. But if you’re gonna gaslight me on your struggles with sobriety as you hotbox a car when I’m not smoking, that is fucking mental ZZ
	Do you think this month has been easy for me?
	Not smoking after I literally haven’t gone a month without weed since I was arrested and had to go to rehab? Did it ever register with you how that similarity may be affecting or impacting me? Have you even verbally acknowledged you’re sorry for going back on your word to commit to that with me? Or no…you’re to busy getting upset with me for not wanting to date a sober person which is actually something I’ve realized when I was 15 after the first time I smoked weed.
	You know how hard it’s been to have a neurological response be totally removed suddenly? And that that conveniently is the same time my fiancé is having an untreated STD outbreak. It would’ve been a totally different response from me if you’d contacted your doctor t like you promised so you’d the medicine on hand to treat it. After me expressing how serious it was to me and scared I am for my health ZZ It’s not like I can receive any other feel good chemicals sexually during that time unless you were willing to get creative which has happened once.
	You want it all but aren’t willing to sacrifice anything.
	And that to me, is not respectable.
	How convenient it is that you picked a time when I am expressing deep feelings about what it takes to move forward in this relationship that you all of a sudden do too.

	STOP SAYING WE
	Do not speak for me. 
	Especially when you’re failing to actually see yourself.
	Do you know how lonely it felt for me to not be able to participate in smoking with my literal best friends and not have you stand with me like you told me you would? 
	If you wanna talk about me not supporting you in struggles, let’s talk. 
	But fucking come correct.
	When Crista started gaslighting me on her insecurities, it was over for her friendship. Blame your issues with sobriety on someone else. Cuz it’s obviously not as serious as you’re making it when it’s convenient for you to throw something back in my face ZZ
	Like I said, I’m not even close friends with sober people. Idk how that makes you think I’m making your struggles about myself when it couldn’t be further removed from you and this life you want to start living. 
	That’s why I have felt you’re fake. Maybe you can better comprehend that now. 
	But lmk if anything is unclear.
	You seem to talk a big game but your actions don’t match your words and that’s scary. Because that hasn’t really changed since the beginning. And that I believe speaks on character.
	If you were genuinely speaking to me out of love, you would’ve come to me first or on a separate occasion and let me have this chance to be genuinely concerned with my feelings and actually acknowledge how I was feeling with an open heart and  security. Instead, you spoke to me out of fear, defensiveness, and a lack of self awareness. And just admitted defeat and affirmed my fears. I started off by saying I was sorry because I know things I was going to say may hurt you in the letter but you have no remorse for anything and show your stubbornness and unwillingness to put any effort. Not once did you say you heard me or acknowledged any of my concerns. You immediately made things about you and that is not sustainable in a marriage. 
	But it is a consistent pattern with you. And it makes me question your capabilities of being a lifelong partner.
	You feel entitled to acknowledgement of struggles but can’t show up for me when you’ve committed to the same. And you are so blind to that it’s crazy.
	You don’t have to drink when we go out, but you make that choice and blame me. The lack of accountable is really immature and tiring David.
	*accountability
	If you want to have a drink, then have one. Don’t blame it on me for doing it cuz you think it’ll make me happy. People can enjoy things in moderation but if you’re not able to do that, it’s not my fault. 
	I moved to NY and consistently asked Sean to take that step with me but he wasn’t willing to compromise or really entertain the idea until it was too late and I left him. I could only do that for so long until I met someone who I felt I had more in common with and a better understanding of who I was. This is how it’s always been for me. If people aren’t willing to make sacrifices to grow with me or together, then i grow apart from them quickly. So I’m telling you that I don’t really feel I can see myself for the rest of my life with someone who’s totally sober, at this point in my life, than I think that’s fair and better you know that now. Definitely Better than lying to you and saying I’ll be sober with you and letting you down. I am impeccable with my word and I can hold true to my character. I don’t know how I’ll feel in the future 20 years from now or after I have kids but I know my present and my past. Maybe I won’t want to do drugs in 20 years but right now I want to live my life to the fullest and a partner who is open to that with me.
	You actually told me you want a different person all together. 
 **(error reading attachment)**
	I wouldn’t waste my time if I really wanted someone different altogether so wtf are you doing 
	YOU want someone else. Which makes sense why I feel like I’m trying so hard and you’ve given up.
	I just never have been with someone who can’t commit to 3 days Minimum of intimacy with me. Not even saying intercourse. If people who have not been my fiancé have been able to soo that with ease, what does that say about someone who claims to do whatever it takes to spend the rest of their life with me
	I don’t understand how that could be so hard and you don’t really seem to care to find out why either.
	Instead you give me rapey vibes after screaming at me. 
	Do you think I forgot how much easier that was for you than being loving and affectionate to me? When that’s all I asked for?
	You tell me you’re scared to ask me a question. Do you acknowledge how scared I felt then? 
	I’ve told you the things that are able to fill up my love tank and make me feel safe and give me the emotional capacity to be in a loving relationship with someone. Stop expecting things to change when you’re not acknowledging that youre not puttting the energy in, in order to get what you want received. Hold the floor for yourself but don’t step onto it only once I have chosen to take a stand to rise up for what I believe and need.
	You’re piggybacking off of my confidence and assertiveness instead of carrying it for yourself and that’s not how relationships work through conflict. 
	What’s the reason you have for not wanting to commit to attempting intimacy at least 3 times a week? Because you don’t want to?
	You’re not sexual? You’re not willing to put in the energy? You can’t change? 
	You expect me to respect the fact that you want to commit to a sober life (something which you don’t have) when you can’t even commit to what I need as a sexually intimate partner (something which you say you’re not)
	Do you understand the disconnect and one sidedness?
	I’m not going to fault you for wanting to live a sober life but I’m going to be honest and say I’ve never wanted a straight edge partner and say that won’t drive me away. Just like you can tell me it’s okay with me to have sex with other people but not feel like that would drive you away. 
	I was actually excited for both of us not to smoke since you claimed for so long that’s what you wanted to do but this was all honestly very eye opening for me.
	Anything you say you need from me, I have committed to trying my hardest to do that and even asked you for ways to help me get there to make it a better habit. That’s the energy I need from my partner. Not false promises and no accountability. 
	You haven’t tried or committed to anything I’ve tried putting in place to reaching the levels of intimacy I need from you. Why am I the one constantly thinking up solutions? When will you try?
	On your own?
	Will you ever?
	Nothing has stuck longer than a week in the last 6 years.
	You tell me you hate when things are brought up from the last but what are you trying to do to change the present?
	Maybe if I had something to hold onto but I’ve been grasping at straws for years. I have no North Star or intimacy and comfort. The memories of loneliness weigh heavier and cut deeper when you consistently don’t show up in the present or follow through with things I really look forward to
	Things you get mad at me for not believing in, but then leave me standing alone waiting
	When you bought the truth or dare game, when you promised you’d buy me a sexy outfit, when you committed to at least having sex on weekends, every time you told me you’d try more to be affectionate in ways you know I need
	When we bought the toys you promised you’d use since you said you couldn’t physically commit to pleasuring me
	Things take will power and perseverance to make changes and we are far from the same in that capacity
	You’re willing to do difficult things if they benefit you, but not if they would benefit us. 
	And it’s really difficult for me to respect that.
	As your fiancé.
	Your consistency to put in the energy/effort or make a plan of deeper intimacy when I’m crying out for affection and telling you my loneliness, just makes me feel that I have been with multiple people who have loved me more. Because if you did as much as you say, why is it so hard to commit to that
	Or even try
	To make a plan to do that.
