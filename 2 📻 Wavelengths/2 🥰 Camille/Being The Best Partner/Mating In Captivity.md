# Mating In Captivity

Reconciling the Erotic and the Domestic

senses are dulled 

Eroticisms and the poetics of sex

when you love someone how does it feel

how does desire differ

Is it possible to want what we already have?

introduce:
risk to safety
mystery to familar
novelty to enduring

care what worry, feel responsible

unselfconciousness fuels erotic pleasure

confuse love with merging

eroticism requires separateness
