when i read this note i get all the feels

It's weird cuz I don't know when you'll see this. It feels like I'm sliding you a note in class. Except I can't watch you read it. 
I conrstantly think about you. 
I just read these 3 articles...

Only defining what we were doing as a rebound in the sense it's so immediate/simultaneous after my last relationship. 
I know you probably don't wanna read those but I would like you too so maybe you can understand more of what I'm going through and more of what you truly deserve. 

I can acknowledge that i have genuine unrelenting feelings towards you but I need to make sure they're backed with complete consciousness and that I'm truly in a place to give you want you need from me and fulfill you emotionally. I don't want to hurt you and I will never do that intentionally. I pulled back to avoid that but I guess I did it to late and I'm learning everyday from my mistakes. I don't want to keep making them. I want to see you flourish, I want to see you happy, I want to see you succeed at everything you attempt, everything you touch I want to turn to gold. You are suchu a beautiful human and I hope I've never made you feel like any less than that. You deserve it all and love in its purest form. 
I'm sorry things aren't easy right now and you have to deal with a lot of painful things. But never forget that everything is temporary. I know you told me this feeling is familiar, so you already know it isn't permanent. This too shall pass. I hope you read this all sooner than later and know that after meeting me, you never have to feel alone. Even though it doesn't feel like I can be there for you in the same way that I was, just know that I will. You are so different than what I know. You've given me so much in such a short amount of time and been actually able to really see me since the beginning. I don't know anymore. I could talk forever. Sorry for always interrupting you. 
I guess I know that this is different because I wasn't looking for anyone when I found you. It just happened.

feels like the first time
when you're looking at me
as if i was the only one
you could see
we were singing in brooklyn
before we were us
times we spent
nights were tough
did whatever i could
but it wasn't enough


we're still the same


karaoke

You promised me that every time we kissed it would be like the first time. 


![[you better not eat my soup.jpeg]]



life is a delicate balance between 
reality and immersive dreams
the line between give and take is grey
the world is so colorful
but without you, the colors will fade.

Everything about you is sweet. 

If you are not standing here how will you get there?
If you really want to get there why are you still here?

You caught me.
I didn't know that I wavs starving till I tasted you


***Act like a plant, think like a child.

Advice my brother received from one of his oldest patients:
We are all here on earth to serve each other. But, the more you love yourself and the kinder you are to yourself, the more you can love others and be kinder to others. You must know love and kindness in order to give it. So don't let serving become a distraction. Spend time on yourself as well.

this is great advice
