## 📝 Observations & Notes

### Daily Habits & Preferences

She likes to make the bed and set out her pajamas in the morning

### Our Dynamic

Well, like I was saying Camille and I are polar opposites. Our love is very unique. Camille is very organized and knows where everything is. She puts things in very specific places and if they are removed, she gets very upset. She also gets upset if I don't put it back if I don't put things back for example, the car keys are often in my pants pocket when they should be hanging up next to the front door in case Camille has to rush out of the house, which happens often. We're both working on things we of course, are both flawed like all human beings and so I tend to go with the flow. Camille hates going into the story. It gives her a lot of anxiety. I love going to the store. It gives me a lot of great ideas of what to cook and stuff like that. I am trying to do a better job of planning out my meals. I was able to cook a couple meals for Camille this month and that felt really good trying to keep that momentum not feeling in my head or in my heart really of like doing a good job to help her and feed her and I guess it's kind of in a way seeking her validation which I can wanna stay away from cause that just gets done a slippery slow, shame, and regret. I tend to be very defensive very irritated that I'm not doing the things that I wanna do Camille says all I ever think about are the things that I wanna do and so I need to be very mindful of that and actually You know do things to help Camille make her life easier really make an impact.
