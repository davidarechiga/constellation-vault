Is the group public? I don't think I can add anyone. 
- Jerry, Tomás, Jose, Carson, Maria, Dan, Anthony, Colin, Jordan, Angus, Liz, Kumasi, Lenny, Chris Izzard, Crista
- Idk if these people were invited or not or if you'd want them to be there/are friends with them? Was just thinking of people while I was on the train. **all those people are dope and i want to have a dope party.** 

this note is rad

Sean was going through my phone and read texts to my friends and saw pics of us and I told him we missed and that I liked you and didn't know what to do anymore and have been feeling very empty and trying to fill myself. And I was selfish and greedy and sorry and he said it's over cuz I'm a cheater and he can never trust me and that he wasted time coming here and now I'm in class. 

I'm having a really hard time..
I have to decide whether to never see you again and choose to be with him. 



I dunno what happened to everything you said on here but I read it like 10 times last night. I never knew I'd find a moon to my sun. You complement me in ways I ever knew possible and challenge me in all the ways I know I need. You are so inspiring and motivating to me and drive me to do better. I see you boy. I see who you were, who you are, and who you will be. I want to know all of you in every stage you pass through. 

**i want to make this happen**

I can't really see a future without you there. Like you said, I never knew you existed. And now that I know, I have a different path that's up to me to choose if I want to take or ignore. I don't want to live with regrets. I guess the last risk I took was moving to NY.

i know i haven't had a serious relationship and that scares you but to be honest i've been searching and looking for the right energy and i think our energies collide in a way that let's us be free in who we are while still keeping us focused and in check

That bee is me. I stay buzzin about you.

## This is crazy. WE'RE CRAZY

"Now's the time to just clear the air
Put this shit back in motion
Put this shit back in motion
Now you finally open, I'm just tryna be only
We been ashin' our roaches
Throw them shits in a bowl and (smoke that shit up)
Rollin' one and mow, now we fired up
Now we both lookin' high as fuck
I been waitin', but time is up
You ain't look me in the eye once
Fuck it, out you in five months
You ain't gotta be shy girl if
Hol' up
You don't know how much
You've helped me grow, you've helped me grow, baby, yeah
You don't know how much I've been tryna show you
I know you felt me though
Ooh, girl I saw this comin'
Don't wanna act all nonchalant, that would mean
That everything we talked about was all for nothin'
Ohh, girl, you know I've been soo afraid
Mmm, hmmm, mmm
Mmm, hmmm, mmm
Baby I've been sufferin', does that mean nothin'?
That's gotta mean somethin'
Baby I would go insane for your love
Fuck what your friends say, 'cause that gotta mean somethin'
This became a little bit too much
Gotta watch my intake, that's gotta mean somethin'
(This how it goin', put that shit back in motion)
Gotta mean somethin'
(Promise everything gonna be kosher)
(Trap soul)"

when he leaves, it's gonna be that much easier for us to fall back into it. i know i'm impulsive but i feel like for the first time in my life i have direction and i have support on such a high level

this has gotta mean something

since day one that connection was strong and i chased it. i knew that there was something bigger for us. maybe i'm just naive. now i understand what it means to focus energy. you helped me with that

You 👀 me. **I** ❤️**you. i 🌹you. i 👸🏿you. i 💡you. i 👅you. you keep me thinking and you keep me inspired. i can't wait to see you again. these two days have been deadly**

Naiive is never a word I would use to describe you.

Link doesn't work

sent you an email 
Mmm boy

i'm not gonna front i'm missing you
you just got me feeling so free

Would you watch the whole season or Real World with me? I need to know. 

i've been dying to watch real world lately. we were talking about it in the gr a couple weeks ago

Dealmaker.
I ain't looking for some short term shit Davíd. I know I've expressed this to you but I feel that if I'm with you, like... It's gonna be for a bigger purpose. But I really need to know that you'll be in it with me. Committed. I'm gonna see you at work, I'm gonna see you when I wake up, when I dream, when I close my eyes, when I breathe...
I just want you to be ready for me. And I know you've never been ready for anyone before. You know that's why I'm scared.

**girl you got me all wrapped up and i'm ready to commit to having you in my life. i'm ready to commit to having a better life and seriously that's you. as long as i know you're mine and i'm yours that's what we need. i am loyal and i will commit. i've had the same job for 9 years babe.** i want to commit to seeing you everyday and waking up with you. for the past two months we've been inseparable and i loved it. i can't wait to spend all my time with you. i know sean is not what you need right now and i am. period. you are just as adventurous as i am and i see you. you question me more than i question myself and help steer me in the direction of my greatest potential. if things ever start to feel stagnant i am confident we will have the right communication skills to challenge ourselves. we are both at a similar time in our lives. you don't need to be afraid of my inexperience. your experience helps with that.
we are going to seek adventure. find things we never knew about each other and ourselves. find new hobbies together. have amazing times and have really rough times.

Youuuu motivated me to start my internship again. I emailed the lady and told her I was feeling stagnant and really missed the lab. I'm gonna try and go in 2 days a week. I figure that'd be a better use of my time than drinking... Right? Lol
But seriously. **You make me wanna be better.**

seriously it will be.

You are honestly one of the coolest people I've ever met. 
^ This is one of the best compliments I can give.

I know I keep saying this but I'm so scared.. I'm So torn. How can I feel like this about you and I just met you? I feel I shouldn't have let it get to this point beforr one door was closed. I was irresponsible but honestly could not help my emotions around you. I need to talk later.

i understand. i understand you are torn. you're asking me to be fully invested but you pull away at the last second and you have every right to. i know you're figuring this all out so there's nothing i need more than patience. 

I'm sorry, I'm not trying to pull away. I'm just trying to see all perspectives that I wasn't acknowledging at all. I have very intense feelings for you to the point where I told my bf I can't just stop talking to you.

am i gonna get to see you?

It’s really hard to read all this again.
