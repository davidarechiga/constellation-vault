I need a reel script and shot list for a new series I want to create.

Title: My Journey to Less Screen Time, More Gratitude, and a New Found Sense of Self Part 1

Description: I am implementing different tactics to reduce reliance on my phone, listen to more music and be more present. I bought a portable cassette player and 4 Track Cassette Recorder. This allows me to record my own productions onto tape but also record my Apple Music playlists onto tape. This is super nostalgic for me as this was some I would do as a youngster. I’m thinking about giving tape players and mixtapes as gifts to people. Having a portable tape players gives me something to hold as I am walking to and from the bus which occupies my hands, something that would normally be used to impulsively hold my phone.
