For the first time in my life, it doesn't cost money to make money. Let me lay it out: I wake up for work and get ready, $0. I walk to the train and ride it into the city, $0. I get off work and take the train home, $0. I unwind to myself until I fall asleep, $0. Although many things in between, like lunch, clothing etc. do cost money, the base cost for gong to work is $0. This is much less than LA. Thankfully I have a job that pays for my transportation. This is a relevant revelation for me because this city tends to get expensive within the finer details. As I struggle to keep self control, I am also realizing the need for balance. Keeping my money too tight will not allow me to do the things that truly make it happy. On the other side, my definition of happy hasn't changed along with all my other parts of life. It seems to be time to redefine and refine my idea of happy used to match my current environment. To be honest this is something I've wanted to do for a long time. Now it's time to put self control into practice. 

1. Make sure I define what I need and budget funds to reflect that. 
2. Save, even if it's $5 a month.
3. Have patience to obtain the things I want
