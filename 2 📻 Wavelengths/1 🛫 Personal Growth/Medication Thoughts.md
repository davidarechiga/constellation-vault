The anti depressants are a nice relief from the resentment that is normally taking over my brain. They create a nice little space for emotions to come and go, freely pass without judgement or criticism. Because of the compassion I’m showing myself, I do feel less impulsive, able to curb any criticism that might have made me eat that extra sweet or order too much food, or smoke a whole joint or go to fieldwork when I walk River or order that extra coffee and waffle at Blue Bottle. When talking about our gym workouts, I would have normally expressed my frustrations about Camille never starting a round on time but this time, I took a step back and found compassion. She stated her goals for class, which was to never use a 10 pound weight. I thought to myself, that’s not my goal. My goal is to never be late to a round and I shouldn’t press that on her. It was a moment where I was extremely proud of because just 2 weeks before that, I would have pressed her. I could see myself saying something like, “why are you never on time for a round?” Later in the week, I had a breakdown , “I don’t want to go back to how things were” was the mantra. I found myself unable to slow down like I was doing the past 5 days. I will continue to monitor and find the courage to speak up for myself, while still filtering the negative thoughts and finding compassion for them.
