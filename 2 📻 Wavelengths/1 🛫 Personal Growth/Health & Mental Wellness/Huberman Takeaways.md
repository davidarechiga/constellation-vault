Alcohol is poison 
Even once a week, there is evidence that habitual and impulsive behavior increases
Alcohol consumption, even at low levels, increases coral output, causing you to feel more stressed after the “good feelings” of alcohol are gone

*The reason I don’t drink is because it makes me more impulsive (buying things I don’t need, drinking that 3rd or 4th cup of coffee, drinking more alcohol, unhealthy eating, binge eating)*
