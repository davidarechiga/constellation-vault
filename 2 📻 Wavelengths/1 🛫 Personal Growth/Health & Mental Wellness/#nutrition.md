### Avoid when possible
- Alcohol. Alcohol can be a major cause of fatty liver disease as well as other liver diseases.
- Added sugar. Stay away from sugary foods such as candy, cookies, sodas, and fruit juices. High blood sugar increases the amount of fat buildup in the liver.
- Fried foods. These are high in fat and calories.
- Added salt. Consuming too much salt can increase the risk of NAFLD.

- Red meat. Beef and deli meats are high in saturated fat.
