*Prep Time: 15 minutes | Cook Time: 25 minutes | Servings: 8 burritos*

## Ingredients
### For the Sheet Pan Mixture
- 2 lbs Yukon Gold potatoes, diced into ½-inch cubes
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 12 large eggs, beaten
- 1 lb breakfast sausage, crumbled
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- Salt and black pepper to taste

### For Assembly
- 8 large (12-inch) flour tortillas
- 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
- 1 cup fresh salsa
- Hot sauce (optional)
- Sour cream (optional)
- Fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)

## Instructions

### Sheet Pan Preparation
1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a large sheet pan (18x13 inches) with parchment paper.

2. In a large bowl, toss diced potatoes, bell pepper, and onion with olive oil, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt, and pepper until evenly coated.

3. Spread vegetable mixture on one half of the prepared sheet pan. On the other half, spread the crumbled breakfast sausage.

4. Roast for 15 minutes, stirring once halfway through, until potatoes begin to brown and sausage is mostly cooked.

5. Remove pan from oven and create wells in the mixture. Pour beaten eggs evenly over the entire pan.

6. Return to oven and bake for an additional 8-10 minutes, or until eggs are set, stirring once halfway through to break up the eggs.

### Assembly
1. Warm tortillas in the microwave for 30 seconds between damp paper towels.

2. Divide the sheet pan mixture evenly among the tortillas.

3. Top each with:
   - ¼ cup shredded cheese
   - 2 tablespoons fresh salsa
   - Additional toppings as desired

4. To roll: Fold in the sides, then roll from the bottom up, tucking in the filling as you go.

### Storage & Reheating
- To store: Wrap each burrito individually in foil and place in a freezer bag. Can be refrigerated for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 3 months.

- To reheat from refrigerated: Microwave for 1-2 minutes, or until heated through.

- To reheat from frozen: Remove foil, wrap in a damp paper towel, and microwave for 2-3 minutes, flipping halfway through.
## Tips
- For crispier potatoes, preheat the sheet pan in the oven before adding ingredients
- Don't overcrowd the pan - use two pans if needed
- Let the mixture cool slightly before assembling burritos to prevent soggy tortillas
- For meal prep, cool completely before wrapping to prevent condensation
## Variations
- Substitute sweet potatoes for regular potatoes
- Add black beans or refried beans for extra protein
- Use different cheese varieties like pepper jack or Mexican blend
- Add roasted jalapeños for extra heat
- Make vegetarian by omitting sausage and doubling vegetables
