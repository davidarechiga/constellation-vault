## **Instructions**
**FILLING:**
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly oil a 9x13 inch baking dish, or spray with non stick cooking spray and set aside.
- Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat.  Add the onions and garlic, cook for 2-3 minutes until slightly soft.  Whisk in the flour.  Allow the flour to cook for 1-2 minutes.  
- Gradually whisk the chicken broth and milk into the flour mixture.  Whisk constantly for 2-3 minutes while mixture bubbles and thickens. Stir in the shredded chicken, vegetables, and seasonings.
- Pour the filling into the prepared baking dish.  Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes before topping with the biscuits.
**BISCUITS:**
- In a large bowl mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, garlic powder, melted butter and milk.  Stir in the shredded cheddar.
- Remove the casserole dish from the oven.  Working quickly, use a 1/4 Cup measuring cup to drop the cheddar biscuits on top of the casserole evenly. Return to the oven and cook for another 15 minutes, until the biscuits are cooked through.
- If using the optional biscuit topping, whisk together all of the topping ingredients in a small bowl and brush over the tops of the cooked biscuits.
- Serve immediately.
