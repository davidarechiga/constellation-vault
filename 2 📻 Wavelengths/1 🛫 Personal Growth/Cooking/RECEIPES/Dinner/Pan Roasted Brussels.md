Brilliant, let's get roasting! Here’s a simple yet scrumptious recipe for your Brussels sprouts with tomato chipotle butter:

### Pan-Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Tomato Chipotle Butter

#### Ingredients:
- 1 package of Brussels sprouts with tomato chipotle butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt, to taste
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- ¼ cup toasted almonds, roughly chopped
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

#### Instructions:
1. Preheat your pan over medium-high heat.
2. While the pan heats up, cut the Brussels sprouts in halves or quarters if they're particularly large, to ensure even cooking.
3. Add the olive oil to the pan, and once hot, place the Brussels sprouts cut side down in a single layer. Season with salt.
4. Let them sear undisturbed for about 3-4 minutes until they start to caramelize.
5. Stir the sprouts and continue to cook until they're tender-crisp and golden brown, about 5 more minutes.
6. Reduce the heat to low, and add the tomato chipotle butter to the pan, stirring until the sprouts are evenly coated.
7. Splash in the apple cider vinegar and stir for another minute.
8. Taste and adjust for seasoning, adding more salt or pepper if needed.
9. Transfer the Brussels sprouts to a serving dish, sprinkle with toasted almonds, and serve warm.

Enjoy the delightful contrast between the earthy Brussels sprouts and the zesty tomato chipotle butter, with a tangy note from the vinegar and a nutty crunch from the almonds.
