When creating these mocktails, remember that the essence is to enjoy the flavors without the psychoactive effects. Ensure that any cannabis-infused products you use are legal in your area and align with your desire for a non-intoxicating experience. The inclusion of a cannabis-infused non-alcoholic spirit should primarily offer herbal and aromatic contributions to the drink.
