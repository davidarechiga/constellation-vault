Instructions
A nod to Cuban chicken and rice, this heady, spicy dish calls for boneless thighs or breasts instead of the usual bone-in pieces, making it weeknight-fast yet thoroughly savory.

When serving this, don't forget to dig down and scoop up some of the crunchy browned rice sticking to the bottom of the pan. It's my favorite part.

1. ﻿﻿﻿In a large bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of the oil, the garlic, cumin, and 1½ teaspoons of the salt. Add the chicken, rubbing the paste all over it, and let it sit for 10 to 30 minutes at room temperature (use this time to gather the other ingredients).
2. ﻿﻿﻿In a 5- or 6-quart Dutch oven, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Arrange the chicken in a single layer and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes on each side. Transfer the pieces to a plate as they brown.
3. Stir in the onion and remaining ¾ teaspoon salt. Cook until lightly browned, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot. (Reduce the heat if the oil starts to burn.) Stir in the tomato paste and oregano and cook another 30 seconds.
4. ﻿﻿﻿Add more oil if the pot looks dry, then stir in the rice and toss to coat the rice with oil. Add the stock and bay leaves, cover the pot, and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes.
5. ﻿﻿﻿Return the chicken and any juices accumulated on the plate to the pot. Cover again and simmer on low until the rice and chicken are cooked through, 17 to 20 minutes.
6. ﻿﻿﻿Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and tent with foil to keep it warm. Taste the rice and add a little more salt, if needed. Remove the bay leaves, then stir the peas and peppers into the rice, fluffing it as you stir. Cover and let sit for 5 minutes.
7. Slice the chicken and serve it with the rice (scraping it up to get at the yummy browned bits sticking to the bottom of the pan), topped with cilantro and scallions and a generous squeeze of lime juice.
