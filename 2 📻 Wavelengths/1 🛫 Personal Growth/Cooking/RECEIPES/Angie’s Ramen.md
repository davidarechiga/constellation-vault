Difficulty scale: Maybe a 4 out of 10 just bc you have to have all the ingredients - it’s super easy! 

Make Ramen egg (2-24hrs before):
Soft boiled eggs (6mins)
Mirin
Soy sauce
Japanese white wine

Broth:
Miso
Chicken or beef broth
Water
Japanese “fungus” 
Japanese seaweed
Fresh pulled noodles (I got them in a Chinese market) 
Different mushrooms/veggies
- bring broth and water to a boil with veggies and miso (taste make sure it tastes like miso!) inside 
- add fungus - boil another 5 mins
- turn heat off
- add seaweed (beware a little goes a long way!) and noodles - cover let sit 5 mins or until noodles cooked 

Porqueta: all prepped in Trader Joe’s just put it in the oven - it takes around 1h30min but it’s huge so lasts a while. When ready to make ramen, slice and pan fry until crisp on both sides 

Assemble the ramen!
