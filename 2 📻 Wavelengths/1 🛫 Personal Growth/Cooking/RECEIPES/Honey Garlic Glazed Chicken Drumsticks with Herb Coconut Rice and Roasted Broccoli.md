## Honey Garlic Glazed Chicken Drumsticks

**Prep Time:** 10 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 35-40 minutes  
**Serves:** 4

### Ingredients
- 1.75 pounds chicken drumsticks
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/3 cup honey
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 4-5 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
- 2 green onions, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds

### Instructions
1. Pat the chicken drumsticks dry with paper towels. Season generously with salt and pepper on all sides.

2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.

3. Add the drumsticks to the skillet, being careful not to overcrowd (work in batches if necessary). Sear for about 3 minutes per side until golden brown all around.

4. While the chicken is browning, prepare the sauce by whisking together honey, soy sauce, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl.

5. Once the chicken is browned on all sides, lower the heat to medium-low and pour the sauce over the chicken.

6. Cover the skillet and simmer for 20-25 minutes, turning the drumsticks occasionally to coat them in the sauce. Cook until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).

7. Remove the lid and continue cooking for an additional 5-7 minutes, allowing the sauce to reduce into a sticky glaze. Turn the drumsticks frequently during this time to ensure they're evenly coated.

8. Transfer to a serving plate and spoon the remaining glaze over the chicken.

9. Garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds before serving.

## Herb Coconut Rice

**Prep Time:** 5 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 20 minutes  
**Serves:** 4-6

### Ingredients
- 2 cups rice, rinsed
- 1 can (13.5 oz) coconut milk
- 1 cup beef broth (that you already have)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons fresh herbs (chopped thyme, rosemary, or parsley)
- 1 tablespoon butter (optional)

### Instructions
1. Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs clear, then drain well.

2. In a medium saucepan, combine the rice, coconut milk, beef broth, and salt.

3. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat.

4. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer for 15-18 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.

5. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.

6. Add the butter (if using) and fluff the rice with a fork.

7. Fold in the freshly chopped herbs just before serving.

## Roasted Broccoli with Lemon

**Prep Time:** 5 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 15-20 minutes  
**Serves:** 4

### Ingredients
- 1 large head of broccoli (about 1.5 pounds)
- 2-3 tablespoons olive oil
- 3-4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 lemon
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

### Instructions
1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).

2. Cut the broccoli into florets of roughly equal size. If you like, you can peel and slice the stems as well.

3. Place the broccoli on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add sliced garlic if using.

4. Toss everything together until the broccoli is evenly coated, then spread the florets in a single layer.

5. Roast in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the edges of the broccoli are crispy and slightly charred, and the stems are tender when pierced with a fork.

6. Remove from the oven and immediately squeeze fresh lemon juice over the hot broccoli.

7. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese if desired.

## Timing Tips

1. Start the chicken first, as it takes the longest to cook.
2. About 20 minutes before the chicken will be done, begin preparing the rice.
3. Put the broccoli in the oven about 15-20 minutes before you want to serve.
4. The entire meal should take about 45-50 minutes from start to finish.
