## Freezing Instructions

## Reheating Instructions

**From Frozen:**

**Microwave Method:**

- Remove wrapping
- Wrap in damp paper towel
- Microwave 2-3 minutes
- Flip and microwave 1-2 more minutes
- Check internal temperature reaches 165°F

**Oven Method:**

- Keep wrapped in foil
- Bake at 350°F for 45-60 minutes
- Unwrap for last 10 minutes to crisp exterior

**Air Fryer Method:**

- Remove wrapping
- Cook at 350°F for 12-15 minutes
- Turn once halfway through

## Tips for Success

- **Keep it mild**: Start with less gochujang - you can always add more
- **Kimchi tip**: Chop the kimchi small and use less than traditional recipes for milder flavor
- **Drain vegetables**: Pat cooked vegetables dry to prevent soggy burritos
- **Cool before wrapping**: Let filling cool to prevent ice crystals when freezing
- **Don’t overfill**: Better to have 8 well-filled burritos than 6 overstuffed ones
- **Serve sauce on side**: Keep extra Korean sauce for those who want more heat

## Flavor Profile

This version gives you Korean-inspired flavors (sesame, soy, garlic, kimchi) with the sweetness of maple sausage and sweet potatoes, but keeps the heat very mild. The small amount of chopped kimchi adds authentic Korean tang without overwhelming spice.
