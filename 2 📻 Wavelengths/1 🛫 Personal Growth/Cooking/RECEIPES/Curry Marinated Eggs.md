## Ingredients

- [x] 1 cup water
- [x] 1/2 cup soy sauce
- [x] 1/4 cup mirin
- [x] 2 tablespoons sake
- [x] 2 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed
- [x] 1 teaspoon curry powder
- [x] 1/2 teaspoon garam masala
- [x] 1 small piece ginger (about 1/2 inch), sliced
- [x] 1 garlic clove, crushed
- [x] 1 tablespoon brown sugar

### For the Eggs
- 6 large eggs, straight from refrigerator
- Ice bath for shocking

## Instructions

### Prepare the Marinade
1. Combine all marinade ingredients in a small saucepan
2. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat
3. Remove from heat and let cool completely
4. Strain and discard solids

### Cook the Eggs
1. Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil
2. Gently lower cold eggs into water using a slotted spoon
3. Set timer for exactly 6 minutes and 30 seconds for jammy yolks
   - For firmer yolks, cook for 7 minutes
   - For softer yolks, cook for 6 minutes
4. Maintain water at a gentle boil
5. Prepare ice bath while eggs cook
6. When timer rings, immediately transfer eggs to ice bath
7. Let cool completely (about 5 minutes)
8. Carefully peel eggs under running water

### Marinate the Eggs
1. Place peeled eggs in a container or zip-top bag
2. Pour cooled marinade over eggs
   - If using a bag, remove air to ensure eggs are submerged
   - If using a container, use a paper towel on top to keep eggs submerged
3. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight
   - Don't marinate longer than 24 hours or eggs can become too salty
4. Remove from marinade and slice in half just before serving

## Notes
- The 6.5-minute cooking time gives you jammy yolks - adjust time based on preference
- For perfectly centered yolks, gently stir eggs in a circular motion for the first minute of cooking
- Save the marinade for a second batch of eggs (within 1 week)
- Pat eggs dry before slicing to prevent marinade from running into ramen broth
- For extra visual appeal, slice eggs with a warm knife for clean cuts

## Storage
- Marinated eggs will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days
- Store in marinade for best results
- Bring to room temperature before adding to hot ramen
