### Key Notes For Reflection
- [[What matters most to me]]
- [[What matters most to Camille]]
- [[Daily Check-in Questions]]
- [Annual Planning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eh3uBFJbAIlWe2NDfyp6y3FgvrxDMhPnGrTM85P3yvc/edit)
- [[Random Reminders]]

### Core Principles

1. Stop-Breathe-Think-Choose
2. Do not drink from the phillips coffee machine
3. Work on Camille's todo-list before anything
4. "I invite you to think differently about…"
5. Make sure to check the Reminders App to other tasks I may need to do. It's not about keeping up. It's about making and maintaining connection to self and to the ones I love.
6. Spending money is a bad habit. Use the Atomic Habits philosophy to curb spending. Remember this when you go to buy something. It's an addiction that needs to stop
7. It's important to address people before speaking at them or requesting their assistance. Think of the training I was given at Apple about how to approach people for help and providing feedback.
8. It's important to think before I speak. I don't need to state what is obvious. Consider if what I am saying is helpful or hurtful.
9. Don't let fear guide your relationships whether that's romantic, platonic, best friendships; relationships with work, school and my hobbies. Fear can show up on many ways. Fear (among other emotions) also drives impulsive spending.
