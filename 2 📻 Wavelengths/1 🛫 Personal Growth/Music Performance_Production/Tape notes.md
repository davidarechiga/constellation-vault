## Tape notes
### Jungle
- Never start with tempo
- Start with vibe
- Make 20 minute versions of songs to flesh out parts
- Never stop the flow of ideas
- Thoughts
	- The more revisions you do the more you have to analyze.

### Fred again
- Work with drones
	- Vocals over drones
	- Chipping from a block of stone
- The depth of the voice is much deeper than a sine wave
- Thoughts
	- There is a vibe that is north when you make a song and it’s important to keep the feeling of that vibe until the song is done. Once you lose the vibe, you lose the song
