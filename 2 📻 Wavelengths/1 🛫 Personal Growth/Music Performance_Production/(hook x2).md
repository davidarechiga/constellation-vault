(hook x2)
sitting on the curb in your hood
head looking down
thinking bout the words that we said
we were good
now you aint around

khiry's verse 

hook twice



verse
you always said
bad bitches they run the town
you were something different
wanted you alone
but that wasn't realistic
you a love child, drug child
don't give a fuck child
past the point of no return
set my mark now it's your turn
faithful til the day that i die
it's only you who i ride
it's only you who i vibe with
sittin with the stars
ive been climbing these ladders
lace you up with them diamonds
like there's nothing that matters but you
and the music
you're the muse
you're the only drug
i could abuse
i can't refuse you
i can't refuse you











never settle never stagnant


but the comfort of timing


never settle never stagnant



got a smile like the sun
girl it's only you that I'm missing
making waves for the past month
holy grain of mad fun
