“You know I’m gonna **make music today in my underwear**. You know what I’m gonna be in my pajamas. You know what, I’m actually just gonna stay inside for the next three days so I can make music.”

There’s no rhyme or reason.

Whenever I get an idea I write it down on my phone and then I go back later and half of them are awful. But every once in a while you get a really good idea.

Don’t force it, let it happen. Any time I’ve forced something you can hear it in the music.

I wanna have a comfortable, amazing experience when I make music every time.

*As a producer* Your only job is to make sure that the song gets done and that everyone doesn’t kill each other before the song’s done.

don’t try to do everything

It’s the artist’s vision.
