Here’s a couple things you can do

1. Compartmentalize your workflow. Split your projects into recording, mixing, and mastering sessions. Use as low buffer size as you can when tracking, focus on gain staging to make sure nothing is too hot, and minimize the amount of plugins you use in recording session. After you’re done recording, export every track as audio and put them into mixing session, here, you can use a high buffer size.
2. Make sure other programs (browsers especially) are not running when you are using logic, this really saves a lot of processing power.
3. Bounce in place as others have mentioned would really help too, especially if you use a lot of software instruments. Bouncing a midi track into audio saves RAM very significantly.
4. Learn about parallel processing, bussing, sub mixes to group your plugins together as much as possible. Example: put eq/compression/multi band comp onto a bus, and route rhythm guitars on far left and far right to this bus. This way, you don’t have to run identical instances on every track. Again, RAM saver.
5. If all these fails, well it’s probably time to get a more powerful computer.
