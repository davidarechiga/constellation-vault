# Lover (demo notes)


![[131bpm_Cm_lover.mp3]]


- Intro is too quiet and slightly boring
	- I do love the Dx7 here
	- second DX7 can stay 2 measures
- Bass comes in too early
- **bass is overall too loud**
	- **needs more sidechain**
- vocals before change are on point
- vocals during change can be brought more forward
- first change is too drastic
	- Bass is not right 
	- in airpods: change doesn’t feel as drastic 
	- vocals need delay here to make them less borning

- Kick is alittle too thin
- second change needs
	- sub or mid bass arp?
- FIll After breakdown needs tweeking
- Breakdown can **maybe** be 16 measures longer
	- chopped Juno lead and come in filters in second half of the breakdown
- more kicks in the outro loop

- post-breakdown is awesome but needs some spice
- Synth loop 1 octave up for last measure
