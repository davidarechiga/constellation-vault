Ableton Audio Effects and Tips

I made a walkthrough of my work process for some of my friends who wanted to start again with producing in Ableton. I think this will help a lot of producers who are on a beginner to intermediate level. This walkthrough will give a short description of all the audio effects I tend to use on my different tracks. Most important will be to train your ear to find the frequencies that not sound right. A big part of producing for me is to use your EQ right and make the correct cuts so every sound has its place in the mix.  
 

**1. Return tracks**

First of I start with setting up my return tracks as my computer is quite slow so this helps me save a lot of CPU

\-Simple delay: Turn on time on the left and right. One side should be put at 1 ms, the other one somewhere between 5-15 ms (or more) depending on your taste and genre. This will help make your drums, pads, synths,.. sound wider.

\-Compressor: We will use a compressor with a heavy threshold, fast attack and fast release (again depending on taste) for parallel compression on our drums so they will have more pump and stand out in the mix.

\-Saturator: Saturator can be used on almost all your tracks (drums, bass, pads,…) to add some harmonics.

\-Reverb: I tend to set up 2-3 reverbs which can be used on different tracks depending on the length of reverb you want. I use nickfever.com to calculate the exact delay time needed. Don’t forget to add the predelay to your delay time to get the correct time.

 **2. Drums**

Kick: The last couple of months I have been using the Kick 2 which has a lot of great presets and the plug-in itself makes it super easy to craft your own kicks. You can also add an extra channel where you use high cut EQ to cut off everything so you just have the low. Give a boost on the lowest root note of your kick to give extra punch to your kick. Don’t forget to tune your kick to the root note of your bass which will give a much more coherent sound

Audio effects:  
 Saturator  
 Compressor for parallel compression  
 Utility (on mono)  
 Sausage fattener (great plugin from Dada Life to give some fatness to your kick and bass  
 EQ: Most of the time I give a low cut around 40hz to get rid of the rumble. Depending on the bass you use you can cut off more and let the bass sit in the lower part of the mix. I also cut out a big part of the kick between 200-500hz (use your ears) to tighten up your kick

 Ghost kick: take one track with a sound that hits on every kick and turn the volume all the way down. This will be used to sidechain other sounds to our kick so it can cut through the mix (Especially in electronic music this will be used often)

 Snare/Clap:  
 Simple delay  
 Saturator  
 Compressor (Depending on the genre I will sidechain the snare to the kick)  
 Reverb: A good trick to create a clean reverb on your snare, hi hat, stab,… is to group it and duplicate the track. One track will be the dry channel and the other the wet channel. Throw a reverb on the wet channel, search for the right start point on your snare to get the most interesting tail. Turn down the dry:/wet on the reverb and the wet channel depending on taste.  
 EQ: Cut off everything under 100-200hz (depending how low the sound of your snare goes) to make room for the kick and bass. Sweep through your frequency to find the annoying sounds to cut away. Find where the meat and snap of your snare is and boost a little here.

Hi hat:  
 Simple delay  
 Saturator  
 Compressor  
 Reverb (again group and duplicate to make a dry and wet channel)  
 EQ: Cut off everything below 500hz (or more)

Shaker:  
 Simple delay  
 Saturator  
 Compressor  
 Reverb (again group and duplicate to make a dry and wet channel)  
 EQ: Cut off everything below 500hz (or more). If you work with a lot of different hi hats, shakers and other percussion, try to solo these sounds and play them together. If some of them clash cut away in your EQ till you find a right combination.

Pan percussion left and right to get a wider feel in your mix.

Tom/Bongo/Conga:  
 Simple delay  
 Saturator  
 Compressor  
 Reverb (again group and duplicate to make a dry and wet channel)  
 EQ: Cut off everything below 100hz (or more) and play together with the kick to find a fluent rhythm and use a high cut to make room for the percussion.

You can pan the bongos left and right so they make your mix more wide.

 **3. Bass**

Most of the time I use operator to make my bass. As algorithm I use the one where the first oscillator influences the second and next to it is the third oscillator influencing the fourth.  
 Oscillator A will be a sine, Oscillator B a saw or square to add some harmonics. I use a an attack around 5-10ms to get rid of the click. The third oscillator I use for white noise to let the bass cut through the mix.

Compressor (I always use sidechain on my bass to make it pump with the kick)  
 Utility (Bass mono/Mono)  
 EQ: Cut off between 35-70hz depending on where your kick sits. Boost around 120hz so the bass can be heard on shitty speakers. Solo your kick and bass and cut where needed so both have nice place to sit in the mix.

 **4. Instruments (guitar, piano, trumpet,…)/pads/synths**

Simple delay  
 Saturator  
 Reverb  
 EQ: Check on your spectrum which notes are played on your instruments. Give these notes a small boost to make them stand out more in the mix. Cut off the low part to make room for kick and bass.

Group your instrument and duplicate it two more times. One instrument will sit in the center and the other two you pan left and right to make your sound more full. Change the volume according to taste. You can also duplicate your channel only once and throw a utility on the second one with a 200% width.

Move your notes up or down and octave to add extra layers or to create suspense in parts of the mix.

I tend to use a lot of the waves plugins to give a different feel to my sounds. For example CLA guitar and Aphex Vintage Exciter and the Maserati plugins have a wide variety of presets for all sorts of genres.

 **5. FX**

For the atmosphere in my songs I use a lot of field recording. Just use your recording app on your smartphone to record sounds in the forest, train station, bars,…  
 Put transients in the right places in your audio file so they fit the song rhythm. Also some sidechain compression can help again to let the kick cut through.

A simple sweep can be created with operator. Choose white noise for your wave, cut off the lows and automate your filter frequency to make the sweep build up.

 **6. Master**

I always use a utility on my master to turn down the width of my mix before the climax. That way the climax will sound bigger.

EQ: Use M/S mode. Use a low cut around 35hz on the mid and a low cut around 100hz on the side. Boost the sides a couple of db around 2khz.  
 Multiband dynamics: I often use OTT with a really low amount. Around 10%.  
 Compressor  
 Glue compressor: The make it loud preset tends to do the job for me.  
 Limiter: Turn the gain until it almost starts clipping (Always leave at least 6db headroom before mastering)  
   
 

Please let me know if there is anything you want to add or let me know if something isn’t correct. I only have been producing for a couple of years myself so I still got lots and lots to learn.

Have fun!
