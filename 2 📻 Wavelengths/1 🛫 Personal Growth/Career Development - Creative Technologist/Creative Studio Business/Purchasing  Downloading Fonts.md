# Purchasing / Downloading Fonts

Reposting what I said in another thread recently:

https://typesupply.com is the one-man foundry of Tal Leming who was at House Industries for several years. Tal is also one of the lead minds/programmers on newer type technology like open type and variable fonts. He knows type inside and out like very few others and his fonts range from the highly-usable Balto (an update on Franklin Gothic) to sci-fi, sporty, elegant styles.

Formerly one half of “Hoefler Frere-Jones” which has just been “Hoefler” for almost a decade now, Tobias Frere-Jones is a masterful type designer (who probably designed a lot of your favorite fonts from “Hoefler” when his name was still on the company’s). His fonts are regularly used by the large agencies working for major institutions like the National Gallery of Art, Carnegie Hall, The Atlantic, etc. Beautiful stuff. https://frerejones.com

Process in Minneapolis make a range of great fonts. You’ll see Bryant in a lot of places and Klavika was used by one of the major networks (NBC?) for their ad spots several years ago. Great resource for open and friendly fonts and they make the great Recipient which is quirky at large sizes and highly legible and readable at text size. Super nice people in my limited interaction with them, too. They’re celebrating their 20th year this month, too! https://processtypefoundry.com

https://lettersfromsweden.se make some of my favorite fonts. Either updates on classic styles or bold, unique fonts with unexpected cuts/detailing.

https://a2-type.co.uk super solid stuff. Pricey but great.

Other foundries who have made some of the fonts you see everywhere:

https://klim.co.nz

https://commercialtype.com (powerhouses / leaders)

https://houseindustries.com (natch)

https://xyztype.com (another House Industries alum)

https://ohnotype.co (friendliest dude, and seems to know exactly how to make the cool fonts everyone wants to use. A young leader /next gen in the field and one of the masterminds behinds the indispensable….

https://futurefonts.xyz which is a clearing house for small and micro (aka 1-person) type foundries like Rüdiger, Very Cool Studio, Franziska Weitgruber, etc where fonts are released “in progress” so you can buy a new font when it only has 1-2 weights for CHEAP. The price goes up time they update the font with more weights or improved kerning or a redrawn numeral set or whatever. Whatever stage you buy in at, you get all the future updates for free. I bought in on fonts 2 years ago for under $40 that are greatly expanded and sell for over $100 now (but I got the later versions free). I’ve also bought in on fonts at $50 that haven’t budged in a while. It’s a roll of the dice but if you see something you like and think “once this is fleshed out to a whole family it’s gonna be amazing!” then pay the low price for the early version to support the designer and net yourself a nice bonus for your discerning eye that spotted a powerhouse in its infancy. When I taught design classes I recommended Future Fonts to my students repeatedly.
