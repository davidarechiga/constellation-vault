# Point, Line, Plane

## Point
- A point marks a position in space. 
	- X, Y Coordinates
	- No Mass
- Series of points creates a line
- A mass of points becomes texture, shape, or plane

## Line
- Indefinite Series of points
- Has length but no breadth (width)
- When a line reaches a certain thickness it becomes a plane 

## Plane
- flat surface extending in height and width
- Shapes are planes with edges

## Shapes and Volume
- Height, Width, and Depth
- Axonometric

## Spatial Translation
- immerse yourself in space and observe from multiple viewpoints
