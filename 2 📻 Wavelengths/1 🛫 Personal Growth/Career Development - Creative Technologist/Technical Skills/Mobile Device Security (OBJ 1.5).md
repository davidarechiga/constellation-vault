# Mobile Device Security (OBJ 1.5)

### Securing Wireless Devices (OBJ 3.4 & 3.5)

Wifi
Protect at highest levels
WPA2 is highest level of wireless security
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Bluetooth
Bluetooth pairing creates a shared link key to encrypt the connection

Wired devices are almost always more secure than a wireless ones

### Mobile malware (OBJ 1.1 & 3.5)
Important to **run Anti-Virus**
Ensure your mobile device is **patched and updated**
Android updates comes from Manufacturer of device
Apple is faster for updates

Only install apps from the official App Store or Play Store
Code is from through a checking process
Digitally signed so they can’t be updated after they are release
Also not 100% safe

Texting Scams / social engineering


- &nbsp;
		1. Do not jailbreak/root device
		1. Don’t use customer firmware or a custom ROM
		2. Only load official store apps (some QC)
		3. Always update your phone’s operating system

### Sim Cloning & ID Theft (OBJ 1.1, 2.4 & 2.6)
		SIM - Integrated circuit that securely store the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number and it’s related key

		SIM Cloning - Allow two phones to utilize the same service and allows an attacker to gain access to the phone’s data

		SIM v1 cards were easy to clone but newer SIM v2 cards are much harder

		Used in two step verification codes

		ID theft
			Be careful where you post phone numbers

### Bluetooth Attacks (OBJ 1.4 & 3.4)

		**Bluejacking** - sending of unsolicited messages to bluetooth enabled devices

		**Bluesnarfing** - unauthorized access of information from a wireless device over a bluetooth connection

		Bluetooth pairing key default is 0000 or 1234
			Make sure to change the default key
		Bluetooth can be turned off when not in use
			At least discovery mode.

### Mobile Device Theft (OBJ 3.5)

		1. Always ensure your device is backed up
			1. Information is most important
		1. Encrypt the device - Full disk encryption
		2. Setup tracking (bring police to location of device)
		3. Remote lock - Requires a pin or password before someone can use the device
		4. Remote Wipe - Remotely erases the contents of the device to ensure the information is not recovered by the thief

### Security of Apps (OBJ 3.1 & 3.5)

Only install apps from official mobile stores
Play Store or App Store

Do not jailbreak/root device

Only use secure version of website (creates a TLS tunnel to web server)

Mobile Device management - centralized software solution that allows system administrators to create and enforce policies across it’s mobile devices

Turn location services off to ensure privacy

Geotagging - Embedding of the geolocation coordinates into a piece of data (i.e., a photo)
Geotagging should be considered when developing your organizations security policies

### BYOD Bring Your Own Device (OBJ 3.5)

BYOD introduces a lot of security issues to consider

Storage Segmentation - creating a clear separation between personal and company data on a single device

Mobile Device management - centralized software solution that allows system administrators to create and enforce policies across it’s mobile devices
MDM can prevent certain applications from being installed.

### Hardening Mobile Device (OBJ 3.5)


- &nbsp;
		1. Update your device to the latest version of the software
		1. Install AntiVirus
		2. Train users on proper security and use of the device
		3. Only install apps from official mobile stores (App Store / Play Store)
		4. Do not root or jailbreak your device
		5. Only use v2 SIM cards with your devices
		6. Turn off all unnecessary features
		7. Turn on encryption for voice and data
		8. Use strong passwords or biometrics
		9. Don’t allow BYOD - Bring Your Own Disaster

Ensure your organization has a good security policy for mobile devices
