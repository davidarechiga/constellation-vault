Marcos referral note:

I have worked professionally with Archie for 4 years while he was a Genius at SoHo and myself a Lead Genius.

When he transferred from Third Street Promenade in CA, he was quick to get to know the team, understand how SoHo worked, and eager to help drive the results that mattered. 

Almost instantly Archie made an impact on his peers due to his technical skills/knowledge and his ability to connect with customers. He consistently exceeded expectations with his results in Net Promoter Score, Same Unit Repair, and Session duration. 

His ability to not just drive his own results but help his peers improve with their NPS, SUR, and session duration, earnedArchie the opportunity to have a Lead Genius Career Experience. While in the experience Archie made sure to leverage his peer relationships and interpersonal savvy to positively impact the customer journey and challenge the team further to help increase our own time results. 

Archie’s work ethic and customer focus was truly exceptional. Working with him as a mentor and then as a peer was an absolute pleasure and any team would be lucky to have him. When he wanted to further his knowledge in computers and networks, he gave his two weeks and showed up every single day with the same enthusiasm and drive as his first days in SoHo.

Now that Archie is starting a new chapter in California he would love to come back to Apple and impact a new team.
