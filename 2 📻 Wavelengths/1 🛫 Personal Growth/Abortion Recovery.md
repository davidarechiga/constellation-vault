I’m sorry you and Camille are going through this. It’s clear you care deeply for her, and your support means so much during such a tough time. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how you can help as her husband:

  

1. Emotional Support

• Listen and Validate: Let Camille express how she feels. Whether it’s sadness, guilt, relief, or confusion, all feelings are valid.

• Communicate Comfort: Reassure her that you’re in this together and that she’s not alone.

  

2. Preparing for the Procedure

• Ask Questions at the OBGYN Appointment:

• Make a list of questions with Camille. For example:

• What does the procedure involve?

• What are the potential side effects?

• What can she expect in terms of recovery?

• Know the Logistics: Confirm details such as:

• Procedure location.

• Required preparation (e.g., fasting, medications).

• Transportation needs (you’ll likely need to drive her home afterward).

  

3. Scheduling and Researching

• Health Insurance: If applicable, confirm insurance coverage and any out-of-pocket costs.

• Supportive Clinics: If you’re unsure about the clinic, research reviews to ensure it’s a compassionate and reputable provider.

• Leave of Absence: Coordinate with her workplace (if she wants) and yours to ensure there’s adequate time for the procedure and recovery.

  

4. Post-Procedure Recovery

• Gather Supplies: Stock up on:

• Comfortable clothes and blankets.

• Heat packs for cramping.

• Snacks and hydration (e.g., electrolyte drinks).

• Over-the-counter pain medications, as recommended by the OBGYN.

• Rest and Care: Plan to be home with her to ensure she feels cared for.

• Monitor Health: Learn the warning signs of complications (e.g., fever, heavy bleeding) and know whom to contact if they arise.

  

5. Emotional Aftercare

• Counseling Resources: Research therapists who specialize in reproductive health if she’s open to it.

• Focus on Connection: Plan gentle, low-pressure activities like watching a favorite movie or taking a walk to help her feel supported.

  

If you’re unsure about the next steps, you might want to follow up with:

• Her OB-GYN: Ask about resources and referrals for aftercare.

• Planned Parenthood or Local Clinics: They often have support services and advice for partners.
