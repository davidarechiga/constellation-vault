How to take a programming class

Week 1
## 1.1 Why Program
Become a creator
We believe everybody should know how to code and speak to computers

Computers want to be helpful
Computers have 1 question: what’s next?

Programmers Anticipate needs
Program is a sequence of stored instructions

## 1.2 Computer Hardware Architecture
**CPU**: Central Processing Unit - asks what’s next - Computer’s brain
**Main Memory**: RAM - used to store information that CPU needs quickly. As fast as CPU
**Secondary Memory**: Storage - used to store files while computer is off
**Input output devices**: Screen, keyboard, mouse**,** microphone speaker, touchpad
**Network Connection:** Communication with other devices

As a programmer, you will mostly be talking with the CPU, telling the CD to use the components.

You are the person who answers the CPU’s questions “What’s Next?”

We’ll call stored Instructions programs and the act of writing these instructions down and getting the instructions to be correct programming

Fetch / Execute Cycle: CPU asks main memory what is next until the program is finished
