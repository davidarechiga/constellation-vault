# 2.2 - Expressions Part 2

### Numeric Expressions
- Because of the lack of mathematical symbols on computer keyboards - we use “computer-speak” to express the classic math operations
- Astericks is multiplication
- Exponentiation (raise to a power) looks different than in math


| Operator | Operation |
| -- | -- |
| + | Addition |
| - | Subtraction |
| * | Multiplication |
| / | Division |
| ** | power |
| % | Remainder |


### Numeric Expressions
>>> xx = 2
>>> xx = xx + 2
>>> print(xx)
4
>>> yy = 440 *12
>>> print(yy)
5280
>>> zz = yy / 1000
>>> print(zz)
5.28

>>> jj = 23
>>> kk = jj % 5
>>> print(kk)
3
>>>print(4 ** 3)
64

### Order of Evaluation
When we string operators together - Python must know which one to do first

- &nbsp;
	- This is called “operator precedence”
	- Which operator “takes precedence” over the others

x = 1 + 2 * 3 -4 / 5 ** 6

1.Parenthesis
2.Power
3.Multiplication
4.Addition
5.Left to right

Operator Precedence

- &nbsp;
	- remember the rules top to bottom
	- when writing code - use parentheses
	- when writing code - keep mathematical expressions simple enough that they are easy to understand
	- break long series of mathematical operations up to make them more clear

What does “Type” mean?

- &nbsp;
	- In python: variables, literals, and constants have a “type”
	- Python knows the difference between an integer number and a string
	- for example: “+” ,ears addition if something is a number and “concatenate” if something is a string
