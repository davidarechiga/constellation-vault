## ✍️ Creating Notes

### Where Should This Note Go?

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Does it have a deadline?** → Projects
   - "Release album by March 2026" → Projects

2. **Is it ongoing responsibility?** → Areas
   - "Weekly meal planning" → Areas/Cooking
   - "Music practice techniques" → Areas/Music Performance

3. **Is it reference/knowledge?** → Resources
   - "Poetry I wrote" → Resources/Poetry
   - "Design principles" → Resources/Design
   - "Book notes" → Resources/Book Notes

4. **Is it completed/inactive?** → Archive
   - "2023 Wedding planning" → Archive

---

### Using Wikilinks

Obsidian uses **wikilinks** to connect notes:

**Basic wikilink:**
```markdown
[[Note Title]]
```

**Wikilink with custom display:**
```markdown
[[2 Music Release (In Progress)|Current Album]]
```

**Linking to headers:**
```markdown
[[Career Development Hub#Design Career Transition]]
```

**🔑 Pro Tip:** Wikilinks work by note title, not file path. Moving files doesn't break links!

## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
- **Start from Home** - Use the dashboard as your launchpad
- **Use Hubs** - Navigate via hubs, not folder browsing
- **Link liberally** - Create wikilinks to connect ideas
- **Capture immediately** - Write it down before you forget
- **Daily notes** - Build the habit of daily logging
- **Review weekly** - Maintain the system with weekly reviews
- **Trust the system** - Information is findable when organized by PARA

### ❌ Don't:
- **Don't over-organize** - PARA is enough structure
- **Don't hoard** - Archive or delete truly obsolete content
- **Don't duplicate** - Search before creating
- **Don't orphan notes** - Link new notes from at least one place
- **Don't skip reviews** - System decays without maintenance
- **Don't overthink** - When in doubt, put it in Inbox and organize later

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I can't find a note"

1. **Try Quick Switcher** (Cmd/Ctrl + O) - Type partial name
2. **Use Omnisearch** - Semantic search
3. **Check relevant Hub** - Browse organized sections
4. **Global Search** - Full-text search for keywords
5. **Check All Orphaned Notes database** - Unlinked notes

### "Where should this go?"

**Decision tree:**
1. Deadline? → Projects
2. Ongoing? → Areas
3. Reference? → Resources
4. Done? → Archive
5. Unsure? → Inbox (organize later)

### "Too many notes in Misc & Unsorted"

**Batch process:**
1. Set aside 30 minutes
2. Review 20-30 files at a time
3. Ask: "What category is this?"
4. Move to appropriate folder
5. Repeat weekly until cleared

### "Links broke after moving files"

**Wikilinks are resilient** - they resolve by title, not path.
- **If broken:** Note might be renamed or deleted
- **Check:** Use "Update internal links" when moving in Obsidian
- **Verify:** Search for the note title to confirm it exists
