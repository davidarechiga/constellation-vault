# SOAR: The Supersonic Grand Prix

## BACKSTORY

1957: Elite engineering teams from rival aerospace companies compete in the ultimate jet age race using experimental aircraft and classified military technology.

## SETUP

**Players:** 3-12 | **Time:** 45-75 minutes

**Team Formation:**

- **Standard:** Odd players = cooperative, Even players = multiple small teams
- **Simple:** Odd players = cooperative, Even players = 2 equal teams

**Components:** 60 Component Cards, 30 Challenge Cards, Race Track, team markers, performance tokens

**Setup:** Deal 5 component cards to each player, shuffle Challenge Cards, place teams at start line.

## GAMEPLAY

### DESIGN PHASE (3 Rounds)

1. Each player secretly selects 1 component card
2. Simultaneously reveal all cards
3. Teams discuss for 2 minutes
4. Repeat for 3 rounds total

### AIRCRAFT REQUIREMENTS

**Required:** Engine, Wings, Fuselage, Landing Gear
**Optional:** Navigation (route bonuses, shortcut access), Fuel Systems (endurance bonuses)

**Performance Stats:**

- **Speed:** Engine values + wing bonuses
- **Reliability:** Average component ratings
- **Handling:** Wing + fuselage combinations

### RACE PHASE

1. **Turn Sequence:** Draw Challenge Card → Roll 2 dice + Speed → Move
2. **Challenge Cards:** Weather, malfunctions, or benefits affecting all teams
3. **Route Options:** Teams in 2nd place or lower may choose risky shortcuts when available
4. **Special Checks:** Doubles = reliability check, some spaces require handling checks
5. **Performance Tokens:** Track permanent damage/bonuses from Challenge Cards

## VICTORY

**Competitive:** First team to complete the circuit wins
**Cooperative:** Complete circuit within turn limit based on player count

**Penalties for Missing Components:**

- No Engine: -3 Speed
- No Wings: Cannot move
- No Fuselage: -2 Reliability
- No Landing Gear: -2 Handling

## COMPONENT EXAMPLES

**Engines:** Turbojet (+3 Speed), Ramjet (+4 Speed), Rocket (+6 Speed)
**Wings:** Swept (+1 Speed, +2 Handling), Delta (+2 Speed, +1 Handling)

## CHALLENGE EXAMPLES

**Weather:** Thunderstorm (handling check or lose turn)
**Malfunction:** Wing Damage (reliability check or permanent handling loss)
**Benefit:** Mechanic’s Assistance (repair permanent damage)

## ROUTE MECHANICS

**Shortcuts:** Certain track spaces offer risky alternate routes that only teams in 2nd place or lower can attempt. Success requires passing a difficulty check based on aircraft capabilities, but provides significant distance advantages. Teams with Navigation components get bonuses on these checks, making strategic component selection crucial for comeback potential.
