## SOAR: The Supersonic Grand Prix

### BACKSTORY & GAME INTRO
The year is 1957, and the world is gripped by the excitement of the Jet Age. In the shadow of Sputnik and the space race, a wealthy consortium of aviation corporations has announced the most ambitious competition ever conceived: the Supersonic Grand Prix, a globe-spanning race featuring the most advanced experimental aircraft ever built.

You represent elite engineering teams working for rival aerospace companies, Lockheed, Boeing, North American Aviation, and mysterious government contractors with unlimited black budgets. Your mission: design and construct the ultimate racing aircraft using classified military technology, experimental jet engines, and cutting-edge navigation systems that push the boundaries of what’s possible.

But this isn’t just about speed, it’s about national pride, corporate secrets, and proving whose technology will dominate the skies of tomorrow. With corporate spies watching every move and the world’s media covering every development, only the most innovative team will claim victory in this high-stakes technological showcase.

**Alternative Simple Rules:**
For groups who prefer simpler team assignment:
- **Odd number of players:** All players work cooperatively as one team
- **Even number of players:** Split into 2 equal teams
**Seating:** For competitive games (multiple teams), players sit so that teammates are not adjacent to each other when possible
**Initial Setup:**
1. Place the Race Track Board in the center of the table
2. Shuffle all Component Cards
3. Shuffle Challenge Cards and place face-down near the race track
4. Deal 5 cards face-down to each player
5. Place remaining component cards as a draw pile
6. Each team places their marker at the starting line
### RULES
**GOAL #1: HOW THE GAME STARTS**
The game begins with the **Design Phase**. Each player examines their 5 component cards privately. These represent the parts available in your workshop.
**Round 1 - Simultaneous Component Selection:**
1. Each player secretly selects 1 card they want to contribute to their team’s aircraft
2. Place selected card face-down in front of you
3. When all players are ready, simultaneously flip all cards face-up
4. **Team Planning:** Teams now have 2 minutes to discuss the revealed components and plan their aircraft design
**GOAL #2: COURSE OF PLAY**
The game alternates between **Design Phases** and **Race Phases** over 3 rounds.
**Design Phase (Rounds 1-3):**
- Players simultaneously select and reveal 1 component card
- After each reveal, teams get 2 minutes to discuss and plan
- Components remain face-up in front of the team
**Aircraft Construction:**
Each aircraft needs components in these categories to be flight-worthy:
- **Power System:** At least 1 Engine card
- **Lift System:** At least 1 Wings card
- **Structure:** At least 1 Fuselage card
- **Landing System:** At least 1 Landing Gear card
Optional systems that provide bonuses:
- **Navigation:** Provides route advantages and shortcut access
- **Fuel Systems:** Provides endurance bonuses
**Race Phase (After Round 3):**
1. **Performance Calculation:** Each team calculates their aircraft’s stats based on their components:
- **Speed:** Total of all Engine values + Wing efficiency bonuses
- **Reliability:** Average of all component reliability ratings
- **Handling:** Based on Wing and Fuselage combinations
1. **The Race:** Teams move around the track based on their aircraft performance:
- Roll 2 dice and add Speed rating
- Move that many spaces on the track
- **Challenge Cards:** At the start of each team’s turn, draw 2 Challenge Cards, choose 1 to apply, and discard the other
- **Route Options:** Teams in 2nd place or lower may choose risky shortcuts when available
- If you roll doubles, make a Reliability check (roll 1 die, must equal or exceed Reliability rating or lose next turn)
- Some track spaces have weather conditions that require Handling checks
1. **Route Cards:** Teams with Navigation components draw Route Cards that can provide shortcuts or avoid hazards
**GOAL #3: VICTORY CONDITION**
**For Multiple Teams (Competitive):**
The first team to complete the circuit around all 6 continents and return to the starting line wins the Grand Circuit and eternal glory.
**For Single Team (Cooperative):**
All players work together to build the best possible aircraft and complete the race within a target number of turns (based on player count). The team succeeds if they finish the circuit within the turn limit, with bonus achievements for exceptional performance.
**Incomplete Aircraft Penalty:**
Aircraft missing required components can still race but suffer penalties:
- Missing Engine: -3 to Speed
- Missing Wings: Cannot move (automatic loss)
- Missing Fuselage: -2 to Reliability
- Missing Landing Gear: -2 to Handling
**Victory Achievements:**
Teams can earn additional recognition for:
- Fastest completion time
- Most reliable aircraft (fewest breakdowns)
- Most elegant design (using fewest total components)
### COMPONENT CARD EXAMPLES
**Engine Cards:**
- Turbojet Engine: Speed +3, Reliability 4
- Experimental Ramjet: Speed +4, Reliability 3
- Classified Rocket Motor: Speed +6, Reliability 2
**Wing Cards:**
- Swept Wing Design: Speed +1, Handling +2, Reliability 5
- Delta Wing Configuration: Speed +2, Handling +1, Reliability 4
- Variable Geometry Wings: Speed +3, Handling -1, Reliability 3
Each component card shows its category, performance values, and special abilities or synergies with other components.
### CHALLENGE CARD EXAMPLES
**Weather Cards:**
- Thunderstorm: All teams must make a Handling check (roll 1 die + Handling rating, need 7+ to avoid losing 1 turn)
- Crosswinds: Teams with Reliability 4+ ignore this card. Others move 2 fewer spaces this turn
- Fog Bank: Teams with Navigation components ignore this card. Others must make a Speed check or get lost (lose 1 turn)
**Malfunction Cards:**
- Engine Trouble: Teams with 2+ Engine cards ignore this card. Others lose 2 Speed this turn
- Wing Damage: Teams must make a Reliability check or lose 1 Handling permanently (place a damage token)
- Fuel Leak: Teams with Fuel System components ignore this card. Others move only half distance this turn
- Navigation Failure: Teams with Navigation components ignore this card. Others move in a random direction (roll 1 die: 1-3 backward, 4-6 forward)
**Beneficial Cards:**
- Tailwinds: All teams gain +2 Speed this turn
- Perfect Conditions: All teams may reroll their movement dice once this turn
- Mechanic’s Assistance: One team may repair 1 point of permanent damage to any system (remove a damage token)
- Upgraded Components: One team places a +1 performance token on any aircraft system (permanent bonus)
### ROUTE MECHANICS
**Shortcuts:** Certain track spaces offer risky alternate routes that only teams in 2nd place or lower can attempt. Success requires passing a difficulty check based on aircraft capabilities, but provides significant distance advantages. Teams with Navigation components get bonuses on these checks, making strategic component selection crucial for comeback potential.

This catch-up mechanic creates dramatic underdog stories where trailing teams can make bold strategic moves to overcome early setbacks through superior navigation and daring piloting.
