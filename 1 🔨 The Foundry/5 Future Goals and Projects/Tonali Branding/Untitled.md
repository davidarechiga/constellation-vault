Representing Tonali Labs as a Latinx-Indigenous brand offers immense opportunity and responsibility. The recommendations below outline best practices for authenticity, language, and ethics, along with the main risks to avoid and proactive commitments to help safeguard your brand’s integrity. ## Best Practices for Authentic Representation - Build genuine, ongoing partnerships with Indigenous and Latinx communities—not just symbolic associations. Collaborate with cultural representatives and, when possible, co-create products, content, or campaigns. - Engage Indigenous consultants, artists, and advisors in brand development—not as decorative voices, but as empowered stakeholders who inform decision-making. - Spotlight lived experience: Share your own journey of reclaiming identity and honoring roots, making it clear you’re not speaking “for” communities but “from” your own intersectional place within them. - Educate your audience openly about the diversity and nuance within Indigenous and Latinx communities. Avoid sweeping generalizations—speak precisely about your own roots and influences. - Ground your messaging in mutual respect, reciprocity, and a commitment to “give back” (donations, educational initiatives, collaborations, etc.). ## Primary Risks and Pitfalls - Cultural appropriation: Using Indigenous symbols, language, or botanicals without permission, profit-sharing, or consultation can lead to significant backlash, legal risks, and community harm. - Stereotyping: Reducing complex cultures to simplistic visuals, motifs, or generalized language undermines authenticity and can reinforce damaging tropes. - Profit without reciprocity: Benefiting commercially from cultural heritage with no mechanisms for community investment or representation is often seen as exploitative. - Speaking for versus speaking from: Presenting the brand as an authority for all Indigenous or Latinx peoples (rather than your own lived experience) can alienate communities and audiences. ## Recommended Language and Phrasing - Use specificity: “Latinx-Indigenous founders inspired by Mexican roots and raised in the U.S.” is stronger and clearer than generic terms. - Capitalize all racial and cultural identifiers: Indigenous, Latinx, Native, Oaxaqueño, Nahua. - Avoid past-tense or dated references (e.g., “ancient wisdom,” “vanishing traditions”)—instead, highlight living, evolving cultures and contemporary identities. - Do not use language implying savior-ism or “giving voice” to cultures (e.g., “preserving,” “saving,” “introducing the world to...”). Instead: “honoring,” “learning from,” “growing alongside”. - Refer to your products as inspired by cultural practices, but not as “authentic” Indigenous products unless made directly in collaboration with those communities. ## What to Avoid - Stereotypical or “folk” motifs without attribution or partnership. - Blanket statements about Indigenous or Latinx culture. - The use of sacred objects, regalia, or names that are not yours to claim. - “Tribal,” “native-inspired,” or “ethnic” as descriptors without context. - Dehumanizing terms or references to colonization unless tied to a message about decolonization, empowerment, or your own journey. ## Key Actions for Credibility - Form an advisory circle of Indigenous and Latinx community members—rotate seats, pay for time, and empower them to critique and steer external messaging. - Invest a portion of proceeds in community initiatives, scholarships, or partnerships, and make that commitment public and measurable. - Share your process: Blog, vlog, or document how you engage communities, how products are formulated, and where learnings come from. - Be transparent and humble: Acknowledge your journey is ongoing, signal openness to feedback, and address mistakes with accountability. - Document your values on your website and in brand books, including protocols for product inspiration, language, and community involvement.
