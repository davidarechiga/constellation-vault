## Phase 1: Prototype & Core Rendering

**Video Title:** Building Frameloop - Visual Editor Prototype (Phase 1)

**Video Description:**

In this video, I'm showing the first working prototype of Frameloop, a visual effects sequencer. Phase 1 focuses on getting the core rendering and real-time preview working.

**What's in Phase 1:**
- Upload images to 4 independent tracks
- Layer them on top of each other with full control over visibility
- Apply geometric shape effects (Circle, Square, Rectangle, Triangle) in two modes:
  - Color Fill: Solid colored shape overlay
  - Mask Mode: Shape reveals/hides the image underneath
- Real-time output controls including opacity, brightness, and contrast
- Session persistence - your work is saved when you reload

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- Drag and drop image uploads to each track
- Toggle track visibility to show/hide layers
- Shape selector with color picker
- Main output effects that affect the final composite
- Responsive canvas that maintains aspect ratios

**What's Next:**
Phase 2 will add playback engine, BPM-synced animation, strobe effects, and shape morphing transitions.

This is an early prototype - there's a lot more to come!
