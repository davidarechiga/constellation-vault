## Summary

Comprehensive childbirth preparation notes from the Alta Bates Hospital intensive class. Covers the **four stages of labor** (early/active/transition labor, pushing, placenta delivery, and initial recovery), **breathing techniques** (cleansing breath, slow deep breathing, hee-hee-hee-hoo pattern), and **pain management options** (nitrous oxide, analgesics, epidural). Includes guidance on **pre-birth preparation** (birth plan, choosing a pediatrician, packing bags by week 36, pre-registering at hospital), **medical interventions** (induction methods, monitoring, cesarean delivery types), and **postpartum recovery** (lochia, perineum care, warning signs to watch for). Also addresses **emotional health** (baby blues vs. postpartum mood disorders affecting ~20% of parents) and provides extensive **breastfeeding resources** and support contacts. Key takeaway: Use the **BRAIN method** (Benefits, Risks, Alternatives, Intuition, No/Not Now) for medical decisions during labor.

> 
> 510-604-3301
> 
> **Here are some things you can be doing to get ready for the birth:**
> 
> **Make a birth plan or fill out the birth preferences worksheet**
> 
> You will bring a copy of this paper to the hospital with you to give to your labor and delivery nurse so she can give you the very best support possible
> 
> If there is a change of shift, the new nurse can get to know you and your preferences quickly
> 
> You can change your mind about anything, so don’t worry if you don’t know all of what you want before birth
> 
> We know that the circumstances of the birth process can change what works best for you!
> 
> **Interview & choose a doctor for your baby**
> 
> This is something you do before birth
> 
> When your baby or babies are born, we will contact the practice and if they have privileges at Alta Bates they can come and examine and discharge the baby
> 
> If they do not have privileges, a staff pediatrician will do this and you will see someone from your own practice during the first week you are home from the hospital
> 
> **Order your breast pump if you are planning to be a breast/chest feeding parent**
> 
> You can order your breast pump early and they will send it to you a month or more before your due date with one baby, by week 32 with twins
> 
> You contact your insurance company and they will give you the information about the company that will fulfill your order and what pumps they cover under your plan
> 
> **Pack your bags in a general way & install the baby car seat –it is great to do this by week 36 if you are having one baby, week 32 if you are having more than one baby**
> 
> Practice how to put baby in, fasten straps etc.
> 
> You want to feel comfortable with how to use it when you are taking baby home for the first time
> 
> You can make an appointment with your local CHP or the 4C’s program in Alameda County to have your car seat installation checked
> 
> Pack bags in a general way for both birth parent and partner or support for your hospital stay
> 
> Partner or support person will be staying with mom in the hospital overnight to help with all the basic baby care and for support
> 
> You can add the things you use all the time like electronics and chargers when you are leaving for the hospital
> 
> **Pre-register at the hospital where you will deliver**
> 
> You can do this through your patient portal or by going on the website for the hospital you are going
> 
> This saves a lot of questions when you come in during labor
> 
> **Register for classes and groups so you feel prepared for: birth, baby care, breast/chest feeding, and postpartum support**
> 
> You will find a list of classes and groups below and in the email we sent to you when you registered for this class
> 
> If you have any trouble registering or have questions or concerns, please call the Parent Education Office and they can help you
> 
> They are typically in the office Monday – Friday,  8-4

> You can leave a message any time and they will call you back
> 
> 510-204-4461
> 
> **Make a Postpartum Plan**
> 
> Do planning now to make the first days and weeks at home easier
> 
> Family, friends, community, postpartum doulas are all potential options for support
> 
> Decide what feels most comfortable and appropriate for your family
> 
> Birth parents will likely need about two weeks of full time support at home after a vaginal delivery and about three weeks after a cesarean delivery
> 
> Birth parents will be needing to rest when they can, move a bit more each day to gain strength, focus on learning to breastfeed if that is way you will feed your baby
> 
> They will not be up to regular life activities during this time
> 
> Help can be great with the basics of life: shopping, cooking, cleaning, laundry, pet care etc.
> 
> This frees up the parent/s to focus on care of the baby and bonding along with recovering from pregnancy and birth
> 
> Plan your leaves from work
> 
> Think about making a meal train or freezing meals ahead of time
> 
> Planning for these early weeks after birth is as important as planning for the birth itself
> 
> **Line up breastfeeding support resources if you will be a breast/chest feeding parent**
> 
> Many birth parents need help with breastfeeding even after they leave the hospital
> 
> It is normal to need support when learning this important new skill
> 
> You can attend free virtual or in person breastfeeding support groups
> 
> You can meet with a lactation consultant one on one at Alta Bates – you can call 510-204-4671 for support and to make an appointment for in person support
> 
> Your pediatrician’s office may have a lactation consultant as part of their staff
> 
> You can attend in person La Leche League meetings for support – in Berkeley they take place every Friday
> 
> There are private lactation consultants that can come to your home
> 
> There are lactation consultants who can meet with you in their offices
> 
> It is wonderful to have so many options, having the information for who to reach out to right away if you are having challenges will make getting the support you need faster and easier
> 
> **Childbirth Class Overview:**
> 
> **The end of pregnancy and your body getting ready for labor:**
> 
> Lightening/Baby Dropping/Engagement:
> 
> About 36/37 weeks your baby will take a dive down deeper into your pelvis
> 
> This allows baby a bit more room as they are growing and filling out before birth
> 
> They are usually head down at this point 
> 
> This allows for greater pressure on your cervix which helps to "ripen" and ready your cervix for the coming birth 
> 
> Your upper body discomforts like less room in your stomach and reflux, and more challenge taking deeper breaths - will feel better when baby is lower
> 
> It will increase your lower body discomforts like low pressure on your pelvic floor, achiness in your hips and possibly lower back 
> 
> The baby may feel heavier as well as lower 
> 
> You will also experience some other getting ready feelings and symptoms as you get closer to delivery:
> 
> Increase in "Braxton-Hicks" or warm-up contractions - most women do not feel any pain with these but they are aware of them happening 
> 
> This is your uterus toning itself for the hard work of labor, delivery and recovery 
> 
> You have been having contractions all pregnancy long, but at the end of the pregnancy more sensation with these practice contractions is common 
> 
> Increased vaginal discharge
> 
> Nesting Instinct kicks in:
> 
> This is you getting ready for your baby 
> 
> We are mammals and we feel more comfortable with our "nest" ready 
> 
> This can be a burst of energy and taking on uncommon cleaning or organizing projects
> 
> Just before going into labor:
> 
> Increased bowel movements or light diarrhea 
> 
> Weight loss of 1-3 pounds the day before going into labor 
> 
> Always call if you concerned about anything you are feeling 
> 
> **The Stages Of Labor**
> 
> **The first stage -**
> 
> This is the part of labor when your cervix effaces (thins) and dilates completely 
> 
> It is the longest part of labor
> 
> If mom were having a 24 hour labor, this would be 21 1/2 - 22 hours of the entire labor process
> 
> It is broken down into 3 phases so you know better where you are in this process
> 
> **Early Labor** 
> 
> If this is a naturally occuring labor this time is generally spent at home 
> 
> Time at home can range from just a few hours to 24 or more
> 
> 12 hours or more is average for a first time mom 
> 
> **Active labor**
> 
> This is the phase where you will come to the hospital if you are laboring at home for early labor
> 
> For a first time mom the acronym that is often used is 511
> 
> 5 - contractions are close together, about 5 minutes apart
> 
> 1 - contractions are at least 1 minute in length
> 
> 1 - they need to stay this way for at least 1 hour
> 
> Please call your provider at any point with questions or concerns 
> 
> Please call when you feel like you are ready to come to the hospital 
> 
> Call the regular office number and they will contact the provider on call if it is after hours 
> 
> Always call before you come in if it is not an emergency 
> 
> **Transition**
> 
> This is when your body finishes dilation - getting you ready to push your baby out 
> 
> It is the most intense time in labor 
> 
> It is the usually shortest phase of the labor 
> 
> **The second stage -**
> 
> This is the stage of labor where you push your baby out!
> 
> Average pushing time for a first time mom is 2 - 2 1/2 hours
> 
> But pushing can range from 20 minutes to 6 hours or so 
> 
> **The third stage -**
> 
> This is the stage where you deliver the placenta
> 
> This happens about 15 minutes after the birth of your baby 
> 
> **The fourth stage -**
> 
> This is the first hours just after birth
> 
> The initial recovery for mom 
> 
> It is the time that we have to bond with baby skin to skin and initiate breastfeeding
> 
> If mom and baby are doing well, baby will stay on your chest for at least an hour 
> 
> The first hour is an important time for making a great connection 
> 
> After that baby will be weighed and measured and have some initial procedures done
> 
> This all happens in the room in your presence and the baby comes right back to you
> 
> If the baby or mom is having any health issues at birth, those will be addressed first 
> 
> **Hee, Hee, Hee, Hoo Breathing Pattern:**
> 
> A deep breath in - making three hee's and a hoooo on the out breath 
> 
> You can take little mini breaths in between or you can make the sounds just on the exhale - whichever feels better to you
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> This is good for when contractions are more challenging and painful/intense 
> 
> It takes concentration to breath in this patterned way, so it gives you a good chance to focus on something other than just the contraction 
> 
> It keeps your mouth and jaw in a more relaxed state
>

> 
> **Dealing With The Pain & Intensity Of Labor -**
> 
> **Things you can do:**
> 
> **Good emotional and physical support**
> 
> When we feel physically and emotionally well supported in labor, we are better able to cope with the intensity and focus on the work at hand
> 
> Birth parents benefits from being supported by someone that she feels very comfortable with, a partner, friend, family member, doula, and birth staff are all resources 
> 
> **Consider having additional support -**
> 
> This could be a family member, friend or a doula (a professional labor support person)
> 
> This can provide opportunities for support
> 
> It can allow the partner or primary support person to have a break if needed
> 
> **Create A Relaxing Atmosphere -**
> 
> Partners and support people should take the time to create a relaxing atmosphere both at home and in the hospital
> 
> Being more relaxed physically, emotionally and psychologically helps labor to progress and helps us to deal with the pain and intensity and feel more confident
> 
> When labor starts, if you will be laboring at home,  take a few minutes to create a more relaxing atmosphere
> 
> When you are admitted to your labor & delivery room do the same thing
> 
> **Ideas for a more relaxing environment:**
> 
> **Lighting**
> 
> softer lighting can be more relaxing, turn off overhead lights if desired
> 
> battery operated candles can be great 
> 
> (don’t light anything in hospital rooms!)
> 
> **Temperature** -
> 
> adjust to what feels best for mom – support people should bring layers in case it is cool for them
> 
> **Play music or nature sounds -**
> 
> a great way to make the hospital room feel more personal - also a way to bring in more energy or to create a more soothing and relaxing atmosphere
> 
> Please bring a speaker with you so you can stream what ever you like
> 
> We are wi-fi enabled for easy access to options
> 
> **Have familiar personal items available -**
> 
> Having your own bathrobe, slippers and clothes to wear after the birth and for going home can be comforting
> 
> Personal toiletries - your own shampoo and lotion etc. can feel nice
> 
> Visual focal point options: photos of people you wish could be with you, photos of a place you go that is always relaxing for you, a photo of your pet, an item or image of religious or spiritual significance, a sonogram picture of your baby, beautiful flowers – whatever might make the space feel more like your own
> 
> Your own pillows (make sure they have colorful pillow cases so you remember they are yours and you can take them home with you)
> 
> **Food and drinks you like -**
> 
> We have basic drinks and there is food service for the birth parent after baby is born
> 
> There is also a celebration meal offered to the new parent/s
> 
> It can be good to bring some snacks and drinks with you for partner or support person throughout labor
> 
> You can bring an ice chest or cooler with you
> 
> There are microwaves on the first floor you can use any time
> 
> Partners and support people can use the cafeteria and you can have food delivered to the hospital and can pick it up on the first floor
> 
> There are also many options for tasty takeout walking distance from the hospital – Whole Foods, Poke’, The Smokehouse for burgers etc.
> 
> **Helpful equipment -**
> 
> Birth ball – we have both the large round birth balls and peanut shaped birth balls, you are welcome to bring your own if you prefer
> 
> Rocking chairs – we have big wooden rocking chairs available
> 
> Massage tools
> 
> Speaker to play music with 
> 
> Camera?
> 
> Computer?
> 
> Special lighting options like battery operated candles 
> 
> **Bring your birth plan or birth preferences worksheet -** 
> 
> This is a great quick way for the staff to get to know you and provide the best possible support 
> 
> Remember - you can change your mind about anything on the birth plan or worksheet!
> 
> **Breathing & Relaxation approaches -**
> 
> It is most important to breathe!
> 
> How you breathe is less important, but specific breathing approaches or patterns can help us deal with pain by increasing oxygen levels and giving us something else to focus on other than the pain of the contraction
> 
> **The approaches we have talked about and tried:**
> 
> Always breathe in the way that is most comfortable for you
> 
> In through your nose or mouth
> 
> Out through your nose or mouth
> 
> Or some combination of the two
> 
> Breathe at whatever pace feels best to you
> 
> It is very common to breathe faster when you feel great discomfort or pain, like at the peak of a contraction
> 
> **Cleansing Breath**
> 
> Do this at the beginning of the contraction and the end of the contraction
> 
> It is the most important breathing technique
> 
> If you no other specific breathing techniques, this is the one you want to focus on doing
> 
> It is taking a really deep breath in – and letting it all the way out
> 
> This quickly raises your oxygen level – this is helpful to you as oxygen helps us to deal with pain and it is helpful to your baby because oxygen helps your baby deal with the very normal stress of the birth process
> 
> **Slow, Deep, Relaxed Breathing**
> 
> This is normal breathing, in and out
> 
> You want to take your breath as low in your body as you can
> 
> Feeling the baby move away from you on the in breath, and back towards you on the out breath
> 
> It can help to imagine the oxygen you are taking in going to your baby
> 
> This is a pattern that often appeals to those who have a meditation or mindfulness or yoga practice
> 
> **In/Out, In/Blow Pattern**
> 
> In this pattern you take a normal breath in and let it out
> 
> Another normal breath in and blow hard on the exhale
> 
> You are blowing out on every other exhale
> 
> To do this you have to focus on the rhythm and not just the pain of the contraction
> 
> So it is helping by shifting some of your focus and the blowing can help release tension
> 
> When it is done at a faster pace it can sound a bit like a train
> 
> **Hee, Hee, Hee, Hoo Pattern**
> 
> In this pattern you take a deep breath in
> 
> On the out breath you breathe out the sounds: Hee, Hee, Hee, Hoo
> 
> Letting out all of the air left on the last Hoo
> 
> You can take little mini breaths in between each sound to keep your oxygen level higher, or you can make the sounds all on the exhale and will feel your abdominal muscles tighten as you exhale
> 
> Both ways work well – it is just what feels best to you
> 
> This has you focusing on the rhythm of the pattern and not just on the pain of the contraction
> 
> This can often be particularly helpful at the peak of the contraction or when the contractions have become much stronger and harder to deal with – but you can do any breathing pattern at any time based on what feels best to you!
> 
> **These patterns can be combined in the same contraction as another way to use these same approaches:**
> 
> The partner or support person can guide the birth parent through the contraction with a rhythm like this:
> 
> Cleansing breath
> 
> 3 rounds of slow deep relaxed breaths
> 
> 3 rounds of in and out, in and blow pattern
> 
> 3 rounds of hee, hee, hee, hoo pattern
> 
> 3 rounds of in and out, in and blow pattern
> 
> 3 rounds of slow deep relaxed breaths
> 
> Cleansing breath
> 
> When you have finished this cycle – the contraction will be over
> 
> Some birth parents appreciate this approach and being able to focus on someone guiding them through the wave of the contraction
> 
> This does not work well for others – worth a try!
>

> 
> **Hypnobirthing –**
> 
> Some women find that this focusing technique can be a very helpful tool
> 
> If you want to have this available in labor, practice before labor
> 
> This approach will not take away all the pain of labor, but it can be a helpful tool for some birth parents

> **Drug Pain Relief Options :**
> 
> These are based on what is available at Alta Bates Hospital 
> 
> If you are delivering at a different hospital, please check with your provider or hospital staff  about what drug pain relief choices are available to you
> 
> You and your provider will make a decision about when in the labor process pain medication makes sense to administer
> 
> Please talk to your OB or Midwife about your concerns regarding pain management
> 
> They want you to have a comfortable, safe & effective labor experience
> 
> **At Alta Bates the three drug pain relief options are:**
> 
> **Nitrous Oxide mixed with oxygen:**
> 
> This is delivered through a mask attached to the tanks with the medication in it 
> 
> Mom holds the mask in place when she wants to use the medication - typically when the contraction is at the peak
> 
> You only feel it when you are breathing it in, the effects are gone when you stop inhaling it
> 
> It can be used from the time you and your OB or Midwife decide it makes sense – all the way through delivery 
> 
> It is a common form of drug pain relief in many places in the world
> 
> It cannot relieve all of the pain
> 
> It can help you manage the pain 
> 
> It does not prevent you from changing to a different drug pain relief option if it is not providing the level of relief that you need
> 
> There are no physical or health risks for mom or baby
> 
> This does not require continuous monitoring
> 
> It does not require staying in bed
> 
> You are able to get up and use the restroom
> 
> You are able to move, use other approaches like the shower or bath
> 
> **Analgesic – a shot of narcotic pain medication :**
> 
> It is usually delivered through an IV catheter that is placed in your forearm
> 
> It is a systemic medication, it goes all the way through the birth parent and baby’s systems and is metabolized out in about an hour
> 
> It is an available option from the time you and your provider decide medication is appropriate - until you begin to push and deliver
> 
> If this approach is working well for you,  a dose can be given about once an hour until pushing begins
> 
> By not giving any more doses after you begin to push it allows all of the medication to be out of the baby’s system before they are born
> 
> The risks of the medication being in the baby’s system at the time of birth is managed by not giving you any more of the analgesic once pushing begins making it a safe option for the birth parent and baby
> 
> If this is not providing you the relief you need, you can move on to the use of an epidural
> 
> This does not require continuous monitoring
> 
> It does not require you to stay in bed
> 
> It does allow you to get up and use the restroom or use other approaches like bath or shower
> 
> **Epidural**
> 
> An epidural can be given whenever you and your OB or Midwife decide it is a good choice to help you manage the pain of labor
> 
> It can be started from earlier in labor through the beginning of the pushing process
> 
> It takes about 15 minutes to administer once the process begins
> 
> Once it is started it will stay in place until after the delivery is complete
> 
> It will take away the pain of labor, but will leave you with awareness of pressure and sensation during contractions so that you can work with your body to push effectively 
> 
> For many women an epidural allows them to relax and sometimes to rest or nap 
> 
> When you have an epidural there are some necessary interventions:
> 
> An IV is started before the epidural is put in place
> 
> There will be continuous monitoring of contractions and baby's heart rate
> 
> An automatic blood pressure cuff will stay on and to check your blood pressure off and on through delivery 
> 
> You will have a blood oxygen monitor on one finger
> 
> Once the epidural is in place, a urine catheter will be placed (you will not feel this being placed)
> 
> Then the anesthesiologist will administer the epidural
> 
> They will have you curl forward around the baby to open the vertebrae in your low back, where the epidural catheter will be placed
> 
> Your partner or support person can help you stay in this position while they put the epidural in place
> 
> First they will clean the area where the epidural catheter will be placed – this feels cold
> 
> Then they will give injections of local numbing medication so you will not feel them place the catheter
> 
> They will use a needle that has the catheter in it to place that catheter into the epidural space – just outside the sack that contains the spinal fluid
> 
> There is no chance of causing damage to your spinal cord with the epidural as they place it below where the spinal cord ends
> 
> Once the catheter is in place,  they will tape it very securely so you can safely move on the bed during labor and delivery
> 
> You will be able to move your body and change positions on the bed if you need or want to
> 
> When you have an epidural might not feel the urge to push right away, letting your body push the baby down without your added effort until the baby is lower in the birth canal
> 
> This is called passive decent
> 
> With your awareness of pressure and some sensation during contractions you can participate more fully in pushing and delivery and can get into different positions which can be helpful
> 
> You will be able to get out of bed about an hour after your baby is born
> 
> An epidural can be used for pain relief for a cesarean delivery as well - if one was already in place for during a vaginal delivery attempt they can up the amount of medication you are receiving so that you are completely numb for the surgery 
> 
> Sometimes for surgery they will use the epidural along with a dose of medication directly into the spinal fluid as well
> 
> This combination can mean there is less sensation of pressure during a cesarean delivery
> 
> **Medical Procedures & Possible Interventions:**
> 
> **Induction & Augmentation Of Labor:**
> 
> Labor could need to be induced for many different reasons
> 
> These reasons can include:
> 
> *Health conditions for mom and/or baby
> 
> *Going too far past your due date – the placenta does not function as well when you are too far past your due date so it can be important to encourage baby out
> 
> *Your water breaks but no contractions begin. The risk of infection rises once your water has broken so at some point it would be important to induce (this is commonly 24 hours or more after the water breaks)
> 
> *Birth parent is of advanced maternal age. It is common to recommend induction at 39 weeks in this circumstance
> 
> *Birth parent has gestational diabetes. It is common to recommend induction at 39 weeks or before for this condition
> 
> *Baby experiencing growth restriction. This is when baby is not getting enough to grow as anticipated while inside, so having them come out and grow on the outside makes sense
> 
> There are many ways inductions can begin – it usually depends on how ready for labor your body is already
> 
> Sometimes inductions can be started in the office of your OB or Midwife and sometimes the whole process will take place in the hospital setting
> 
> Your provider will talk to you about what approaches make sense and where and how the induction will take place
> 
> Induced labors can be faster than naturally occurring labors or they can often take longer as your body is encouraged into labor
> 
> Some induced labor can take two to four days
> 
> It is good to prepare for the potential for a longer labor and bring what will help you feel more comfortable if this is the way your labor unfolds
> 
> Options for induction can include:
> 
> *Sweeping the membranes – this is done in the OB or Midwife’s office and can be done more than once
> 
> The stimulation of the cervix with this procedure can lead to further ripening and softening of the cervix or in some birth parents it can generate contractions
> 
> *Prostaglandins/cervical ripeners can be given orally and/or can be placed in the cervix directly
> 
> This can help the cervix to ripen and soften quickly which will make it better able to respond by thinning and opening once contractions begin
> 
> For some birth parents this generates contractions and puts them into labor on it’s own
> 
> This is given in the hospital
> 
> *Placement of a catheter is a common approach during an induction
> 
> It is inflated with saline to provide pressure on the itself to help stimulate contractions
> 
> *Pitocin – this is a lab made version of the oxytocin that your body creates
> 
> It stimulates contractions
> 
> It is delivered through an IV attached to a pump and is increased slowly until you are having effective contractions
> 
> *Artificial rupture of the amniotic sack – this is a painless and quick procedure
> 
> It will bring the baby’s head more firmly in contact with the cervix during contractions which can make the contractions more effective
> 
> Induced labors can go more quickly than a naturally occurring labor
> 
> Or
> 
> It can lead to a longer labor, for some women even a 2-3 or 4 day labor
> 
> If mom’s body is not ready to respond to the contractions once they are generated it takes longer for labor to work
> 
> This is why some approaches are used to help “ripen” and ready mom’s cervix so that when contractions do start they can be more effective
> 
> Some women’s bodies do not respond effectively or it takes a longer time for their bodies to go into labor
> 
> There is a higher incidence of distress for the baby if Pitocin is necessary in your induction
> 
> The use of Pitocin comes with continuous monitoring of the baby’s heartrate
> 
> Many of these same approaches can be used to **augment labor**
> 
> Meaning they can be used to help generate more effective contractions
> 
> This can be an important option in a labor is not progressing
> 
> Some women will begin the process of induction in the office of their provider and then labor at home for some time before coming to the hospital
> 
> Some women will have their entire induction experience take place in the hospital
> 
> You and your OB or Midwife will decide what approach is best for your labor
> 
> **Monitoring:**
> 
> **External monitoring:**
> 
> External monitoring of both the baby’s heartbeat and contractions is done used to be sure that baby is tolerating the normal stress of labor
> 
> If you come to the hospital in labor you will likely have about 20 minutes of monitoring done while you are in triage
> 
> Many birth parents will have intermittent monitoring done, this is usually about 10 minutes out of an hour up until pushing to check in on how baby is doing
> 
> Once you are ready to push and deliver monitoring will be continuous
> 
> There are times when it is important to do continuous monitoring:
> 
> If the baby shows signs of distress – monitoring is continuous from that point on
> 
> If there is anything given to mom that could increase the chance of distress in your baby, the monitoring will be continuous from that point on, this includes Pitocin to augment or induce labor
> 
> If you choose an epidural for pain relief monitoring is continuous
> 
> External monitoring is done with two belts that are strapped on to the belly, one to monitor the baby’s heartbeat and one to monitor how long and how far apart the contractions are
> 
> There is about an 8 foot cord from your body to the monitoring machine
> 
> You can be standing, sitting on a birth ball or in a rocking chair if you are mobile
> 
> You can be lying in bed as you would be with an epidural for monitoring
> 
> There is a sound component to this that will allow you to hear your baby’s heartbeat this sound can be turned off
> 
> The information gathered will be displayed on a computer monitor – this too can be shut off if it is distracting or not helpful
> 
> There is also a paper recording of the monitoring being done
> 
> There is a sound component so you can listen to your baby’s heartbeat – or the sound can be turned off if you prefer
> 
> These monitors can show the length of the contractions and how far apart they are, but it does not show how strong the contraction is
> 
> The purpose is to look at the relationship between the contractions and the baby’s heartrate
> 
> We also have wireless monitors that can allow for more freedom of movement if that is helpful
> 
> **Internal Monitoring:**
> 
> There are two kinds of internal monitors
> 
> One to determine the baby’s heartrate which is called a fetal scalp electrode monitor
> 
> It is attached to the baby’s scalp and provides very reliable information
> 
> Once it is applied, it would stay in place for the rest of the labor
> 
> This is used about 6% of the time
> 
> There is also an intra uterine pressure catheter that can tell the strength of the contractions
> 
> The tube is placed inside the uterus and is squeezed during the contraction
> 
> It could be helpful to know how effectively the uterus is contracting when a labor is not progressing effectively
> 
> This is used about 1% of the time
> 
> Internal monitoring is not common but can be very helpful when needed
> 
> If mom is having twins vaginally, twin A may have the internal monitor used and twin B would have the external monitor so they can clearly distinguish between the babies
> 
> **IV’s:**
> 
> When you get to your labor and delivery room, you will be asked to have an IV catheter placed in your forearm
> 
> This is to allow quick access to a vein if needed to deliver fluids or medication
> 
> If it is not needed right away, (and usually it is not), it can be capped with a saline lock
> 
> That means you don’t have the bag of fluids or medication flowing unless needed – just quick access
> 
> You will need IV access for:
> 
> Fluids to treat dehydration
> 
> To administer IV antibiotics before baby is born if you are strep B positive
> 
> To administer analgesic pain medication (systemic medication for pain relief)
> 
> To keep your blood pressure steady with an epidural
> 
> For a cesarean delivery
> 
> Not all women need IV access during delivery, but many do
> 
> You can decline having the catheter placed and ask to have it done only if medically necessary
> 
> Once the IV catheter is in place you will not feel it so it could be easier to do earlier in labor in case it is needed later
> 
> **Second Stage Interventions – those that could be used during pushing and delivery:**
> 
> **Vacuum Extractor:**
> 
> During pushing and delivery sometimes it is necessary to give a little help at the very end to ease baby out
> 
> Use of a vacuum extractor can be the perfect assistance and is very safe for both mom and baby
> 
> It is used about 6% of the time
> 
> The OB or Midwife will apply the vacuum extractor cap to the baby’s scalp and use the amount of suction for a good attachment
> 
> When you are having a contraction and bearing down, your provider can help to pull and guide the baby out
> 
> They will only continue this approach if it is making a difference in baby moving
> 
> **Episiotomy:**
> 
> An episiotomy is a cut made in the perinium used to widen the vaginal opening allowing the baby to be born more quickly
> 
> This can be necessary if baby is in distress and very close to being born
> 
> Or if the birth parent is too tired to push effectively
> 
> Or if the birth parent is having a health issue that means baby needs to be born more quickly than they could be pushed out
> 
> There are no routine episiotomies done any longer
> 
> It is not a common intervention and your chance of needing one is small
> 
> **Tears in and around the vagina or perinium:**
> 
> Some women experience some degree of tearing
> 
> Naturally occurring tears usually heal very well
> 
> Tears are rated in degrees with stage one being the least impact and not usually requiring stiches, up to stage four which is a very serious tear that requires more repair
> 
> Stage four tears are very unlikely
> 
> Ways you can reduce the change of tearing:
> 
> Your practitioner will do perennial massage with oil as your baby is delivering – helping the tissues to stretch
> 
> Many use a warm compresses to help you relax your perinium
> 
> Being in more upright positions for pushing and delivery can help you to open more fully and let gravity do some of the work
> 
> Taking time and not trying to push the baby out quickly can give more time for natural stretching of the tissues
> 
> Doing prenatal yoga and other exercise that helps you become more aware of your pelvic floor and how to work with it during delivery
> 
> One of the biggest factors in whether you might tear or not is genetics, whether you have more elastic skin or dryer less elastic skin
> 
> There are courses now in pushing effectively and protecting the pelvic floor
> 
> **Cesarean Delivery:**
> 
> Cesarean delivery can be necessary to protect the health of mom and/or baby
> 
> There are three ways a cesarean delivery can happen:
> 
> **Planned Cesarean** –
> 
> This is done for many reasons including:
> 
> Previous cesarean delivery
> 
> Previous uterine surgeries that don’t allow for safe vaginal delivery
> 
> Multiples beyond twins
> 
> Some twin deliveries
> 
> Malpresentation – baby being in a position that doesn’t allow for a vaginal delivery – breech or transverse (lying sideways) babies
> 
> Some medical conditions in mom and/or baby
> 
> Placenta previa – where the placenta has implanted partially or fully over the cervix
> 
> Mom is awake for the delivery and your partner or one support person is present
> 
> It is usually possible to do a ‘Family Friendly Cesarean’ when it is a planned cesarean
> 
> **Unplanned Cesarean –**
> 
> This occurs during what was expected to be a vaginal delivery, but circumstances change so that it is safer for mom and/or baby to have a surgical delivery
> 
> This can be due to:
> 
> Changes in baby’s heartrate indicating that baby is experiencing distress
> 
> Labor not progressing despite efforts to help
> 
> Other health concerns for mom or baby
> 
> Mom is awake for surgery
> 
> Partner or support person attends the birth
> 
> It is often possible to do a ‘Family Friendly Cesarean’ if birth parent and baby are doing well
> 
> **Emergency Cesarean –**
> 
> An emergency cesarean is the least common kind of surgical delivery
> 
> It happens when it is very urgent to have the baby born as quickly as possible
> 
> In a true emergency baby can be born just a few minutes from the decision to do the surgery
> 
> The birth parent is asleep for delivery with general anesthesia
> 
> Because they are asleep, the partner or support person is NOT welcomed into the operating room
> 
> As soon as baby is born, partner and baby are brought together
> 
> Once the birth parent is awake after surgery, if the baby is doing well the partner or support person can bring them to bond with the birth parent
> 
> Partner can do skin to skin with baby if desired
> 
> If baby needs to go to the NICU (newborn intensive care unit) partner will accompany the baby and stay with them until the baby can join mom or mom can visit baby
> 
> **Family Friendly Cesarean Birth –**
> 
> This is possible when birth parent and baby or babies are doing well at birth
> 
> Drapes can be lowered, or a clear drape can be used so that the parents can see the baby being lifted up as they are being born
> 
> Baby can be placed on birth parent’s chest after the birth and can stay there while the surgery is completed
> 
> Please discuss this option with your provider and see if it is possible during your cesarean birth
> 
> **Cesarean Recovery:**
> 
> Women recover well from cesarean delivery – especially if you don’t push too hard in the beginning of your healing
> 
> You can expect to have some pain that will be helped with medication for as long as you need it
> 
> An epidural at first, narcotic pain medication and then non-narcotic
> 
> You are usually in the hospital for 2-4 nights after a cesarean delivery
> 
> It is important to plan for a partner or support person to stay with the birth parent in the hospital to help with care of the baby
> 
> Babies room in, meaning they stay in your postpartum room with you
> 
> This allows you to learn how to care for the baby before you are at home on your own
> 
> The staff can help you learn and feel more confident
> 
> If you are a breast/chest feeding parent, the lactation consultants will support you and baby as you learn this new skill
> 
> Partners or support people do the diapering, dressing, swaddling, burping etc. while in the hospital so the birth parent can focus on the initial recovery and can rest when possible
> 
> This is good to continue when you get home for about two weeks after a vaginal delivery and three weeks after a cesarean or very complicated delivery
> 
> Babies will be feeding every 1-3 hours or about 8 – 12 times per 24 hour period
> 
> Having around the clock support will allow birth parent and baby to focus on feeding and rest at home too
> 
> Make a plan for how you will handle an unexpected cesarean delivery as most cesareans are unexpected
> 
> Walking is fine as soon as mom feels ok doing so
> 
> Vigorous exercise is usually not advised for a few weeks after surgery, your OB or Midwife will let you know when it is recommended
>

> 
> **Postpartum Healing:**
> 
> It takes a whole year to recover completely from pregnancy and birth, be patient as your body gets back to normal
> 
> Surround yourself with support in the first weeks after delivery so that you can really focus on bonding, feeding, and resting, then your recovery time will be faster
> 
> Anything that you can do to simplify your obligations and life before birth can be helpful
> 
> If you can have help with basic tasks like shopping, cooking, cleaning, pet care etc.., you could feel less overwhelmed
> 
> Try and put some practical plans into place before birth to make this early time as easy as possible
> 
> There are easy ways to do this like using Meal Train or other organizational apps to schedule help
> 
> If you are planning to have visitors soon after the baby is born, try and prioritize those who will be there to help
> 
> You will not feel up to entertaining or taking care of someone else for awhile after birth
> 
> Thinking ahead of time  ahead of time of the ways family or friends could provide support can make it much easiser
> 
> Be sure they are aware:
> 
> Partners do a lot of baby care
> 
> Baby will be sleeping in the same room with the parents as a part of SIDS prevention
> 
> Breast/chest fed babies don’t usually get a bottle or pacifiers for about 4 – 6 weeks after birth

> 
> **Uterine Involution –** the uterus going back to it’s pre pregnancy size and shape
> 
> After the baby is born your uterus begins to shrink, returning to it’s pre pregnancy size 6-8 weeks after birth
> 
> This process is called involution
> 
> Small contractions after the baby is born make this happen
> 
> Breast/chest feeding can help the uterus to heal faster as it helps encourage these after birth contractions
> 
> These contractions can feel a bit like menstrual cramps or very mild birth contractions
> 
> **Lochia:**
> 
> After birth there will be bleeding and discharge as the body recovers from pregnancy
> 
> This flow is very heavy bleeding in the first hours after birth
> 
> The flow can be heavy enough in the first 24 hours that you might pass blood clots, this is normal and will not last more than a day or two
> 
> By the time you get home from the hospital, you should not be having large clots any longer – if you do, call your provider
> 
> The flow of heavy bleeding will last some days, then the discharge will change to a brownish color, then white, then clear and then the discharge is finished
> 
> Using pads only for this flow is important, do not use tampons or diva cups
> 
> Nothing should go in the vagina during this flow as the risk of infection is very high
> 
> This flow will usually last 3-8 weeks after birth
> 
> **Symptoms of concern to watch for:**
> 
> If you develop a fever  - a temperature of  100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius or higher
> 
> A very foul smelling vaginal discharge, which could be a sign of infection
> 
> Pain during urination
> 
> Increased abdominal pain
> 
> A red area, hard lump, or pain in your leg/s
> 
> Pain in your chest
> 
> A red, hard lump  and or painful area in your breast
> 
> Increased, heavy bleeding or passing large blood clots
> 
> Your perineum is not feeling more comfortable over time
> 
> Your incision from a cesarean delivery is red, painful, hot, or there is a discharge from the area – also if the incision site opens up
> 
> Anything else that concerns you
> 
> **Dealing with a sore perineum:**
> 
> After a vaginal delivery it is normal to feel some discomfort or soreness
> 
> The vaginal tissue and perineum are stretched during delivery leading to swelling and often a hot or burning feeling especially during urination
> 
> Using a peri bottle (a squeeze bottle you fill with WARM water) to spray the area during and after urination until you are not sore is a real help
> 
> You will be given a peri bottle at the hospital and can take it home with you
> 
> There are some good ways to help yourself feel better as quickly as possible:
> 
> Ice packs on the perineal area for the first 24 hours after birth feel soothing and can help decrease swelling
> 
> We have pads with quick ice underneath at the hospital
> 
> After the first 24 hours getting the perineal area into warm water every day until you have no more soreness will be both soothing and help with the healing process by increasing blood flow to the healing area
> 
> You can do this in a bathtub, or you can use a Sitz bath device
> 
> You can order a Sitz bath online  
> 
> It fits onto the toilet so it is very easy to use
> 
> You can use a special herbal “tea”  you put into the water you are soaking in and can feel good
> 
> If you are very sore a donut pillow can give a lot of comfort and relief
> 
> There are numbing sprays that your provider can prescribe if needed
> 
> Taking over the counter pain relievers can help with the discomfort
> 
> If it does not seem to be getting better, please contact your provider
> 
> **Emotional Changes after birth:**
> 
> **Baby Blues:**
> 
> The majority of women feel somewhat vulnerable and emotional after the birth
> 
> This is likely due to a combination of things: lack of sleep, hormonal changes, new responsibilities, others sharing opinions about how we should do things, isolation…
> 
> Often these feelings ease on their own without intervention
> 
> If you are feeling better over time you probably don’t need to do anything other than try and make things as easy for yourself as possible
> 
> If these feelings are getting stronger and are harder to deal with, please call for support
> 
> It is always better to call and get the support you need so you can enjoy as much of this time as possible as you get to know your new little one
> 
> **Postpartum Mood Disorders which can include:  Depression, Anxiety, and OCD symptoms**
> 
> About 20% of moms or  partners develop a postpartum mood disorder in the first year after birth
> 
> This usually doesn’t go away without treatment and support
> 
> Symptoms can include:
> 
> Not being able to sleep/rest even when you have the opportunity to do so
> 
> Changes in mood
> 
> Crying or sadness that does not get better over time
> 
> OCD – obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms
> 
> Feelings of frustration, anger or rage that are stronger than what you usually experience
> 
> Feelings of inadequacy or dependence
>
