# Music Distribution Research for Independent Record Label 2025

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive research of current music distribution platforms, **LANDR** emerges as the best overall value for your record label needs, followed closely by **Ditto Music** with their unique “Record Label In A Box” service. While DistroKid remains popular, it has significant limitations and hidden fees that make it less suitable for label operations.

## Key Findings

### Why You Should Consider Upgrading from DistroKid

1. **Hidden Fees**: DistroKid charges extra for many essential features ($12/year per cover song, $49 per release for “Leave a Legacy,” additional fees for YouTube Content ID)
2. **Limited Label Support**: Basic plans don’t support multiple artist names effectively
3. **Music Removal Risk**: Your music gets removed if you stop paying (unless you pay the expensive “Leave a Legacy” fee)
4. **Poor Customer Service**: Known for slow response times and limited support

2. **Clear cost savings** - no hidden fees unlike DistroKid
3. **Better label support** - designed for multi-artist operations
4. **Risk-free migration** - your existing music and data transfer over
5. **Improved features** - better analytics, included services, permanent hosting

## Action Plan

1. **Immediate**: Sign up for LANDR Basic ($23.99/year) to start testing
2. **Month 1**: Upload 2-3 releases under different artist names
3. **Month 2-3**: Evaluate performance and features
4. **Month 3**: If satisfied, migrate remaining DistroKid catalog
5. **Future**: Consider Ditto’s RLIAB if you want formal label structure
