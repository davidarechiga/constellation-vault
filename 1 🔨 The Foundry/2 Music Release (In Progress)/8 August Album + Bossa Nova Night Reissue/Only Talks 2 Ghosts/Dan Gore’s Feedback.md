## Summary of Feedback:

### General Mixing Notes:

• EQ adjustments and sub/low-end balancing needed across tracks (especially for car listening).

• Sound sculpting on drums recommended.

• Sub-bass levels should be tamed.
## Track-Specific Feedback:
### The Matriarch:
• Strong intro, but bird/forest noises should be lowered to let drums, guitar, and keys shine.
### The Keeper & The Echo:
• Good structure, just needs EQ and some drum sound sculpting.
• Appreciation for RX950 plugin’s effect.
### The Raven:
• Drums and beat are great, but sub is too intense.
• Violin at 2:14 clashes with vocals and feels out of place.
### The Mirror (Favorite Track):
• Unique blend of lo-fi hip-hop and jam band.
• Amazing bassline.
• The break at 1:38 should happen only once.
• Outro change-up not necessary; main hook should stay.
• DJ perspective suggests making the outro easier to mix out of.
### The Shadow (2nd Favorite):
• Housey vibes are great.
• Beat should return after breakdown; outro could be shortened and used as a breakdown instead.
### The Healer:
• Just needs EQ, maybe some compression/side-chaining.
• Otherwise ready to go.
### The Ghost:
• Beautiful outro.
• Could experiment with a beat overlay for a special remix version.
### Final Thoughts:
• Mixing should be tested in various environments (car tests, etc.).
• Keep an eye on sub-bass levels.
• Play around with drum sound sculpting.
• Overall, strong work!
