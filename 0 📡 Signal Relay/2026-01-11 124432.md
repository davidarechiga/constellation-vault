- Mountains are probably filled with diamonds. If you are still like the mountain, you can feel the shining, fascinating diamond that you are.

A note on the etymology of fascination:
From Latin facinatus, past participle of fascinare. "Bewitch, enchant. A charm, spell, witchcraft. To fascinate is to bring under a spell by the power of the eye or tongue. Hence a subtle, irresistible influence upon the imagination, reason or will.
