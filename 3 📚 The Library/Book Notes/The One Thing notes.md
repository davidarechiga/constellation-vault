The One Thing notes



<span style="font-size:29pt;"><b>Will power:</b></span>

Will power is a resource that can run dry

“where there is a will there is a way” is a lie

timing is everything

What taxes your will power:
- Implementing new behaviors
- filerting distractions
- resisting temptation
- suppressing emotion
- restraint aggression
- suppressing impulses
- taking tests
- trying to impress others
- coping with dear
- doing something you don’t enjoy
- selecting long term over short term rewards

if you want to get the most out of your day, do your most important work - your one thing - early.

Big Ideas for will power:
1. Don’t spread your willpower too thin
2. monitor your fuel gauge
3. time your task

don’t fight your willpower. build your days around how it works and let it do its part to build your life. Willpower may not be on will call, but when you use it first on what matters most, you can always count on it

Balance is a lie and can never really be achieved.

Purpose, meaning, significance are what make a successful life.

extraordinary results require focused attention and time. **time on one thing means time away from another**

If you think of balance as he middle, then our of balance is when you’re away from it. Get too far away from the middle and you’re living at the extremes. The problem with living in the middle is that it prevents you from making extraordinary time commitments to anything. In your effort to **attend to all things, everything gets short changed** and nothing gets its due.

magic happens are the extremes

Time waits for no one. Push something to an extreme and postponement can become permanent.

“Is attending a young child’s soccer game on par with attending a soccer game with an adult child?”

start replacing the work balance with counter balance

whether or not to go out of balance isn’t really the question. The question is: “do you go short or long?”

in your

5 aspects of life: work, family, health, finds, and integrity

big ideas:
1. think about two balancing buckets
2. counterbalance your work bucket
3. counterbalance your personal life bucket

The success habit

the focusing habit is the foundational habit i use to achieve extraordinary results and lead a big life. i use it for something and not at all for others. i apply it to the important areas of my life: my spiritual life, physical health, personal life, key relationships, job, business, and financial life. I address them in that order l, each other is a foundation for the next.
