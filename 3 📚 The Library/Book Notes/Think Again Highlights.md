# **Think Again Highlights**

**Prologue**
- Opening story: Smokejumpers and the Mann Gulch fire (Montana) of 1949. The team was inserted into challenging conditions and the fire quickly overtook them. Some smokejumpers held on to their equipment (as they were trained to do) despite the added weight (possibly) preventing them from surviving. Wagner Dodge made a quick decision to build an escape fire and lay down in the charred area while the wildfire raged around him. Most of the other smokejumpers perished.
	- In addition, the mission was based on mistaken assumptions about wildfires—that immediate suppression was the optimal strategy. We’ve since come to rethink our approach to remote wildfires.
- Conventional vs. new views of intelligence:
	- Conventional view: intelligence is the ability to think and learn.
	- Alternative view: intelligence is the ability to rethink and unlearn, i.e. flexible thinking. Grant argues these cognitive skills are essential in a turbulent and changing world.
- Psychologists find that test takers who second-guess their answers usually have better outcomes with their revised answers.
	- **First-instinct fallacy**: Your gut instinct or first response isn’t always right (even though we are taught to trust our gut).
	- “We don’t just hesitate to rethink our answers. We hesitate at the very idea of rethinking.”
- “Questioning ourselves makes the world more unpredictable. It requires us to admit that the facts may have changed, that what was once right may now be wrong.” 
- **Seizing and freezing**: the phenomenon where we “stick to our guns.” In part, we do this for psychological comfort. 
- Everyone carries cognitive tools that are regularly used and seldom questioned or subject to reflection or scrutiny. These include beliefs, assumptions, opinions, and more. 
**Part I: Individual Rethinking** **Chapter 1: A Preacher, a Prosecutor, a Politician, and a Scientist** **Walk into Your Mind**
- Opening story: Mike Lazaridis, the founder of the BlackBerry smartphone. Lazaridis was brilliant and turned BlackBerry into a popular business tool. But when the iPhone was released, Lazaridis failed to change his thinking to respond to a rapidly changing mobile device market. He stubbornly clung to the idea that people wouldn’t want to use smartphones for games, entertainment, and other tasks (beyond email, phone calls, and texting). 
- It’s easy to notice when *others* need to change their opinions, but difficult for us to develop the same habit for ourselves.
	- “When it comes to our own knowledge and opinions, we often favor *feeling* right over *being* right.”
- Phil Tetlock’s (political scientist) mindset model: Preachers, prosecutors, and politicians.
	- **Preachers**: We pontificate and promote our ideas (sometimes to defend our ideas from attack). Changing your mind is a sign of moral weakness.
	- **Prosecutors**: We attack the ideas of others, often to win an argument. Being persuaded is defeat.
	- **Politicians**: We try to win the support of others, optimizing for approval and agreement (over personal conviction). We change our opinion opportunistically.
- **Scientist**: Grant appends this professional worldview to Tetlock’s mindset models.
	- Rethinking is fundamental to scientific thinking.
	- “You’re expected to doubt what you know, be curious about what you don’t know, and update your views based on new data.”
	- Search for truth through testing hypotheses, running experiments, and uncovering new truths.
	- Changing your mind is a sign of intellectual integrity and a response to evidence.
- “Hypotheses have as much of a place in our lives as they do in the lab. Experiments can inform our daily decisions.”
	- In a study of entrepreneurs, a test group was encouraged to use scientific thinking to develop a business strategy. The test group outperformed the control group significantly and tended to pivot twice as often.
- Remember: real-life scientists can easily fall into preacher, prosecutor, politician modes too. They too are prone to forgetting their professional tools. 
- **Cognitive bias**: Seeing what we want to see. 
- **Desirability bias**: The tendency to act in a manner that enhances your acceptance or approval from others. 
- **Instead of searching for reasons why we are right, search for reasons for why we are wrong.** 
- “The purpose of learning isn’t to affirm our beliefs; it’s to evolve our beliefs.” 
- **The rethinking cycle**: Humility => Doubt => Curiosity => Discovery 
- **The overconfidence cycle**: Pride => Conviction => Confirmation and Desirability Biases => Validation 
**Chapter 2: The Armchair Quarterback and the Imposter**
- Opening story: Ursula Mercz, in the late 1800s, was diagnosed as blind but insisted she could see and was completely unaware of this fact. Researchers in the 20th century reported similar findings: patients unaware of their situation and unable to learn from experience.
	- **Anton’s syndrome** is a condition whereby an individual is oblivious to a physical disability due to damage to the occipital lobe of the brain.
- “In theory, confidence and competence go hand in hand. In practice, they often diverge.” 
- **Armchair quarterback syndrome**: Phenomenon where confidence exceeds competence. 
- **Imposter syndrome**: Phenomenon where competence exceeds confidence. 
- **The Dunning-Kruger effect**: Identifies the disconnect between competence and confidence. The most confident are often the least competent.
	- We routinely overestimate our abilities.
	- David Dunning: “The first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is that you don’t know you’re a member of the Dunning-Kruger club.”
- **Competence and confidence don’t progress at the same rate:**
	- We mistake experience for expertise.
	- Beginners rarely make Dunning-Kruger errors.
	- But a small amount of knowledge can create big problems with the Dunning-Kruger trap as confidence climbs faster than competence.
- “Humility is often misunderstood. It’s not a matter of having low self-confidence. One of the Latin roots of *humility* means ‘from the earth.’ It’s about being grounded—recognizing that we’re flawed and fallible.” 
- **Confident humility**: An ideal wherein the individual has faith in their abilities but retains sufficient doubt and flexibility to recognize they could be wrong. Because of this they remain curious and flexible, always seeking the truth.
	- Be confident in your ability to learn more than in your knowledge (which is malleable).
- “A mark of lifelong learners is recognizing that they can learn something from everyone they meet.” 
**Chapter 3: The Joy of Being Wrong**
- Opening story: 1959 Harvard study by Henry Murray (psychologist). Murray designed a test in which subjects (Harvard students) were interrogated. The interrogators would aggressively assault the subjects’ world-views (the goal was to mentally stress the participants). Students whose identities and ideologies were strongly intertwined (non-flexible thinkers) cracked. Those who embraced flexible thinking did not. One of the subjects was Ted Kaczynski (The Unabomber); he had one of the strongest negative responses to the study. 
- View being wrong as a good thing; an opportunity to learn something new. 
- Isaac Asimov: “Great discoveries often begin not with ‘Eureka!’ but with ‘That’s funny...’” 
- **Totalitarian ego**: Psychological term for the mental gate-keeper that keeps threatening information out of our heads. Our mini internal dictator. 
- Richard Feynman (physicist): “You must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.” 
- Decouple your identity from your beliefs. Better yet, make your identity one in which you actively seek truth and knowledge—this opens you up to curiosity and rethinking. 
- Two types of detachment:
	- Detaching your present from your past.
	- Detaching your opinions from your identity.
- “Who you are should be a question of what you value, not what you believe.”
	- Values are core principles like excellence, generosity, freedom, fairness, integrity, etc.
	- Values retain flexibility that opinions do not.
- “Better judgment doesn’t necessarily require hundreds or even dozens of updates. Just a few more efforts at rethinking can move the needle.” 
- Actively seek out reasons why you might be wrong. Even a single idea can curb overconfidence. 
- Jeff Bezos: “People who are right a lot listen a lot, and they change their mind a lot. If you don’t change your mind frequently, you’re going to be wrong a lot.” 
- Jean-Pierre Buegoms (forecaster):
	- Make a list of conditions in which your forecast holds true.
	- Make a list of conditions under which you would change your mind.
**Chapter 4: The Good Fight Club**
- Opening story: Orville and Wilbur Wright and the chemistry the two brothers had as intellectual partners. They challenged each other's thinking and this allowed them to improve their ideas through a continuous feedback loop.
	- Wilbur Wright: “Honest argument is merely a process of mutually picking the beams and motes out of each other’s eyes so both can see clearly.”
- **Relationship conflict**: Personal feuds and arguments (e.g. “I hate you!”). 
- **Task conflict**: Arguments over specific ideas and opinions (e.g. “What should we eat for dinner?”).
	- Task conflict can be beneficial and generate better outcomes.
	- Be careful to avoid letting task conflict turn into relationship conflict.
- **Challenge network**: A trusted group of peers to point out blind spots and errors in our thinking. 
- **The illusion of explanatory depth**: We think we know more about things than we really do.
	- When pressed to explain *how* something works, our understanding breaks down.
	- Example: How does a bicycle, piano or appliance work? Exploring these questions reveals the limits of our knowledge.
**Part II: Interpersonal Rethinking** **Chapter 5: Dances with Foes**
- Opening story: International debate champion Harish Natarajan vs. Debra Jo Prectet (later revealed to be a computer AI). Debate topic: Should preschools be subsidized by the government? Harish must argue the unpopular position of being against subsidies (most of the audience starts with their minds made up for subsidies). Harish uses a powerful combination of techniques—common understandings, non-judgmental questions, flexible thinking—to win over some in the audience.

- Soft 
- Adversarial vs. collaborative approach:
	- **Adversarial approach**: Common tendency to go into preacher or prosecutor mode without listening to the other party.
	- **Collaborative approach**: Leads with humility and curiosity. Invites the other party to think like scientists.
- **Logic bully**: Someone who overwhelms others with rational arguments. The others might not agree with those arguments, but they are left defenseless and bitter. 
- Tactics of expert negotiators:
	- Plan ahead to determine where they can find common ground.
	- Present fewer reasons to support their case. Weak arguments dilute strong ones.
	- Express curiosity with questions like “so you don’t see any merit in this proposal at all?”
	- Express their feelings about the process and their opponents feelings, e.g. “I’m disappointed in the way this has unfolded, are you frustrated with it?”
- “We won’t have much luck changing other people’s minds if we refuse to change ours. We can demonstrate openness by acknowledging where we agree with our critics and even what we’ve learned from them.” 
- Use a **steel man** (instead of straw man) and consider your opponent’s strongest argument. 
- The stronger a person’s belief, the more important the quality of the reasons or justifications. 
- “The person most likely to persuade you to change your mind is you. You get to pick the reasons you find most compelling, and you come away with a real sense of ownership over them.”
	- Posing questions and letting the other person draw their own conclusions is more powerful than trying to give them your answer.
	- Stop trying to convince others about the right answer. Open their mind to the possibility they might be wrong and let them work their way to the solution.
**Chapter 6: Bad Blood on the Diamond**
- Opening story: Daryl Davis is a musician and a Black man. In 1983, he was playing a gig. He struck up a conversation with a white man who was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Rather than respond with hostility, Daryl was curious. He asked the man “How can you hate me when you don’t even know me?” The men became friends and the KKK member eventually renounced his membership. Daryl has gone on to befriend a number of former members who have similarly disavowed their past beliefs. 
- Strong opinions like stereotypes and prejudice are less likely to be reconsidered. 
- “A rivalry exists whenever we reserve special animosity for a group we see as competing with us for resources or threatening our identities.” 
- We identify with our group or tribe. We distinguish ourselves from our adversaries—they are everything we are not.
	- We preach the virtues of our side.
	- We prosecute the vices of our rivals.
- As social beings, we are motivated to seek belonging and status. Group identification helps us achieve these goals. 
- **Group polarization**: The phenomenon where we interact with people like us. This results in more extreme beliefs.
	- Conformity with group orthodoxy maintains cohesion.
	- Status is gained by holding the purest expression of these views.
- Many beliefs are arbitrary and based on flimsy foundations. 
- **The overview effect**: Astronauts experience space travel gain a unique understanding of humanity. After seeing Earth from above, their perspective changes and the see the commonality of our existence. 
- **Counterfactual thinking**: considering alternative realities, imagining different circumstances and outcomes. 
- “The very notion of applying group stereotypes to individuals is absurd.” 
**Chapter 7: Vaccine Whisperers and Mild-Mannered Interrogators**
- Opening story: Marie-Helene Etienne-Rousseau of Quebec gives birth to a child. The child is premature. Marie-Helene is against vaccines, but the child would benefit from a measles vaccine. A “vaccine whisperer” is called in. He exhibits many of the characteristics of skilled negotiators from Chapter 5. He leads Marie-Helene to decide for herself to vaccinate her child. 
- **Motivational interviewing**: The best approach to changing someone’s mind is to help that person make the change on their own.
	- “We don’t know what might motivate someone else to change, but we’re generally eager to find out.” 
	- Three key techniques are used:
		1. Asking open-ended questions.
		1. Engaging in reflective listening.
		2. Affirming the person’so desire and ability to change.
	- Gentle recommendations that allow the other person to maintain agency are offered like: “Here are a few things that have helped me—do you think any of them might work for you?” 
	- The interviewer serves as a guide, not a leader or advisor. 
- “Listening well is more than a matter of talking less. It’s a set of skills in asking and responding. It starts with showing more interest in other people’s interests rather than trying to judge their status or prove our own.” 
- “Many communicators try to make themselves look smart. Great listeners are more interested in making their audiences feel smart.”
