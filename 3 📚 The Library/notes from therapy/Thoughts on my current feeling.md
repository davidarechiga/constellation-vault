I am hurting inside. Today was hard. Today, I couldn’t find the key. I couldn’t overall my energy was low enough thought I felt like I had a good start to my day. Maybe all hands took the energy out of me. I am feeling like Yvette should be able to do research on computers. Why is resentment coming up for me right now. I was POC for this delivery, Misak set it to hold based on Bills feedback and Kevin was noticeably annoyed with the decision to hold the package. His reasoning made sense. Once it was in our hands, we no longer had insurance on the package and if something broke, the loss would be costly.
