Here's some things I try to implement in my workflow: 

1. Write as fast as you can - once you have a 8-16 bar loop, start making an arrangement quickly (i'd suggest using another track to get arrangement inspo)

2. Use placeholder sounds, if you can't do a build up, or verse, or melody - use something close enough and come back to it once you've fleshed out your idea

3. Kill your babies quickly, and try making variations as quick as you can, the faster you can reduce the noise both visually and audiotorially (not sure if that's a word) the faster you'll write "the next part of the track"

People may disagree on this one - but mix as you go, sculpt the sounds as you would like to hear them while you're putting them down or very shortly after so you're not feeling like you have a thousand things to do linearly which can feel overwhelming
