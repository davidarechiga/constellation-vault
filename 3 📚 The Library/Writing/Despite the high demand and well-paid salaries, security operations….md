Despite the high demand and well-paid salaries, security operations analyst is not a career I want to pursue because of the frequent burn-out, the long on-call hours, and the high-stress environment that comes with the job. 

Even-though cyber security is in high demand, high turnover rates lead me to believe I won’t enjoy the job. 

Frequent reports of burnout are a sign that I will be overworked.

Cyber Security often comes with a high-stress environment which doesn’t fit my easy-going personality.

A 24/7/365 on-call schedule is not something I am looking for because I want to spend more time with my family and friends.

Although I consider myself a life-long learner, the high stakes of new cyber threats put too much pressure on me at this age.
