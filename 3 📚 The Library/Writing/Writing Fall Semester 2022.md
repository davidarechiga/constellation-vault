#Clarifying

In other words, the knowledge that an action is good for you is not enough to make create a habit. This is similar to watching documentaries about the food industry. After watching these documentaries, I am always left with the knowledge of how our food is produced, which is often terrible for the animals as well as unhealthy for humans, but I don't make a change to start eating food I know is sourced from good places because the act of buying food from known good sources is not satisfying enough to create the habit. This is a significant mental break through because you can turn any knowledge to a habit by simply adding a small reward that is consistent with the habit you are trying to create.
