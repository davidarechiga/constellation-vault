# fSMM: Week 2

**Participation Self-Reflection** 

This week, I shared my screen with a break out room that included Thais and others, we talked about the difference between a goal and a should. We presented this to the class. I also answered the first question about Introductory Paragraphs aloud to the class. Outside of class, I posted a quote from James Clear in the scholar lounge and attempted to engage my peers in healthy conversation about habits.

💥**Impactful Moment**💥 **SMM**

**Say:** Dr. Jay states, "I stopped thinking about whether what I was doing was below me. I learned to not
worry about how to make it to the next level and just focus on the job at hand. If they were
willing to let me do it, I was willing to try.” (45)

**Mean:** To clarify what Dr. Jay means,  she is basically putting all her concerns aside to live in the present moment and trust that the work she is doing will eventually lead to a new opportunity even if it’s not clearly visible at the moment.

**Matter:** This matters because it is incredibly important to not dwell in the past or future but to exist in the now and have the faith that everything will work out if you don’t over complicate for decisions.
