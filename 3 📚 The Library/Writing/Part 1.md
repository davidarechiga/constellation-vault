	- **Say:** According to the author, “Weak ties are the people who can change your life for the better—both right now and in the years to come—if you have the courage to know what you want.” (32)
	- **Mean:** To put it differently, it’s really up to you to do the homework of finding out what you want out of life and put yourself out there for people who may not be a familiar to you. 
	- **Matter:** Therefore, you may look at other and think, “they are so lucky to get those opportunities,” but luck isn’t some random eternal force that is either working for you or against you. Luck is an odds game. The more you put yourself out there, the more chance you have at opening the right doors at the right time.
