# SMM: Week 4

**Participation Self-Reflection** 

This week I shared my screen when going over the chapters of Atomic Habits we read.  I also unmuted during class discussions and participated in debates about whether or not participation should be graded. I enjoyed debating with my classmates because I like expanding my thoughts on these topics.

💥 **Impactful Moment**💥 **SMM**

**Say:** “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.” (Clear 63)

**Mean:** Clear is giving a simple but not so obvious process to build habits with what he calls *habit stacking*. 

**Matter:** This matters because clear is breaking habit forming in a way that is very digestible and easy to replicate. When process are complex and difficult to execute, they are often overlooked or ignored completely, leading you to believe you aren’t good enough or skilled enough to complete it. The way Clear explains habit forming, I feel like anyone is able to become the person they want to become.
