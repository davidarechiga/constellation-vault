DUMBO DUMBO DUMBO 

so my favorite thing to do in New York solo or on a date so if you need to get away from your crew this is a really nice thing to do was my favorite thing and I think youll really love it.

take the F train to York Street. when you get out just walk down the hill towards the water there's a restaurant called Pedro's go there have a margarita and order Pedros style fries. it's not on the menu it's only for people who live in the neighborhood it's very tasty. when you're in that neighborhood just walk around there's a really really cool record shop and I think you'd really love it. then just walk around. go to Brooklyn bridge park and feast your eyes on one of the most inspirational views you ever seen I. your life. 

if you wanna take

t a step further instead of taking the train walk across the manhattan bridge into Brooklyn on the south side of the of the bridge. 

outside of that I recommend renting a bike and riding it around Central Park and the Westside highway. it's been a while since I've been in NY and really explored. a lot of things have changed. but the the first thing I do every time I'm there.

go to the blue room at the museuM of natural history. it's suggested donation. I always give a dollar when I'm there. don't feel pressured to give more. a lot of starving artists and students.

suggested donation for the. Metropolitan museum of art I highly recommend that my favorite part of that museum is the hall of European sculptures and I will go there at least once a month

that's all I got for you though I highly recommend the first one again. I know you well enough to know that you would love that shit.
