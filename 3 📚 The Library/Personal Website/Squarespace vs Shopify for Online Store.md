Squarespace = general purpose / personal use
- cheaper
- less e-commerce tools
- no automating with Zapier
- content ready out of the box
- huge template library
- advanced product display options
- additional apps for creating high-quality visual content

- POS only works with Square


Overall:
“Overall, independent sellers and small businesses can probably get what they need from one of Squarespace's four packages or Shopify's Basic offering. Bigger sales operations might find that Squarespace's commerce capabilities aren't going to cut it, making Shopify's more expensive tiers an easy choice.”
