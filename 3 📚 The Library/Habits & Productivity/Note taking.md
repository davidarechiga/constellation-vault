# Note taking 

Your choice of pencils/pens/paper are pretty personal.
- Experiment and find what works best for you. 
	- I personally prefer **graph paper** (quad and milimeter paper) for maths. 
	- **Paper density** is also something that is personal, I don't like the very thin pieces of paper. 
Use different notebooks for lectures and "your actual notes" (from which you will study).
- Notes during lectures 
	- Often very **scrambled**, and they should be 
	- Add small bits and pieces to make sure you can understand everything when studying at home 
	- Can look more like a sketch than actual notes, don't worry 
	- **Arrows** everywhere. 
	- **Don't cram** too much on one page 
	- **White spaces** are important to keep a clear view 
- Your notes to study from 
	- Go over the course matter, both textbook and lecture notes 
	- **Find a structure** in the madness 
		- Focus inwards: 
		- Start at the chapter title 
		- Then find the subheadings 
		- Then spot the nuances per subtitle 
	- Found a structure? 
		- Focus outwards: 
		- **Find the logical coherence** of the subheadings 
		- Then the same for the larger headings and finally the chapter 
	- Start composing notes 
		- Split up workload per subhead 
		- Check if you can still see the logical coherence every now and again 
		- **Clean written** 
	- Colors 
		- Your best friend! 
		- Make sure you don't overdo it though, these are notes, no paintings! 
So all in all:
1. Get a notebook for your lectures, this can be graph paper, can be blank paper. Don't worry about clean writing too much. 
2. Once you revise at home: find structure and logical coherence. Make sure you understand the nuances. Use some wastepaper to sketch a structure! This step is usually not done in 1 try. 
3. Compose your notes. Find your favorite paper. Make sure it's clean written and don't be afraid to use colors!
