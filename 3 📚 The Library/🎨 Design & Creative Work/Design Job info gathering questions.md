To get a clearer picture of your needs and provide an accurate quote,  can I ask a couple of questions:

1. What is the primary goal of your website? (e.g., client bookings, showcasing services, information hub)

2. Who is your target audience? (e.g., businesses, individuals, legal/medical clients)

3. Do you have a logo, brand colors, or a style preference for the design?

4. Are there any websites you like or want to model yours after?

5. What key features do you need? (e.g., contact form, online booking, live chat, multilingual support)

6. Will you need a blog or a section for news/updates?

7. Do you require a client portal or login system?

8. Will you be selling services or products directly on the website? (E-commerce integration)

9. How many pages do you expect the site to have? (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact, etc.)

10. Do you already have written content, or will you need help with copywriting?

11. Do you have professional images, or will photography/stock photos be needed?

12. Do you have a preferred domain name and hosting provider, or will you need assistance with that?

13. Will you be updating content yourself, or do you need an easy-to-use CMS like WordPress?

14. What is your budget range for this project?

  

Asking these questions will help you create a website that meets their exact needs while managing expectations for cost and delivery time. Let me know if you’d like a refined email draft incorporating some of these!
