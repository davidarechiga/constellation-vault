First idea
Use my outline of life’s priorities/question to make graphic art now yes, it’s not necessarily graphic design because it’s not made to communicate something other than my own feelings so I will call it graphic art for now

Second idea
Illustrate over photographs using illustrator

Third idea
Make cover art for my playlist
Often times he’s already have a good name that I can work with, and a good photo. This is really weird illustrating on top of photographs, make the workflow, engaging, mindful of my personal life, motivating in a type of synergy art that I really like I do, want to start photographing more, so that that’s an overall good part of the skill mastery 

I think these ideas are great practice runs and will allow me to continue to further both my illustration skills and my skill mastery
