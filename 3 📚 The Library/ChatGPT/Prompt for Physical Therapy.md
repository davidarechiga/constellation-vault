ChatGPT as my physical therapist and personal trainer for the last 2 months - amazing

Over the last \~2 months, I've been using ChatGPT to create workouts for me that specifically address both my scoliosis/spine issues and my physical fitness goals and I'm never looking back. 

To start, I used a simple prompt "Act as a physical trainer and develop a workout routine for me that is 45 minutes in length and incorporates stretching, strength training and cardio in each workout" this was sufficient, but provided mostly generic results. 

As I was suffering through my cardio one day, I started to think about how I could improve the prompt to be more specialized towards me and my body and my goals. I've been evaluated by a physical therapist, so I have a diagnosis (S-Curve Scoliosis) as well as symptoms (tight IT bands, lat pain, etc). I also have some recommended exercises that the physical therapist gave me. 

With these three ingredients, I first started a prompt engineer conversation:

"act as an expert ChatGPT prompt engineer, transform my freeform text into a prompt for ChatGPT that will be best understood by ChatGPT" 

Into this conversation, I dumped my "ingredients" (my diagnosis, my symptoms and my recommended exercises" and out came a prompt similar to this one that I edited to be a bit more specific to my liking (ie. the idea of "segments"). The most important thing I did was also ask it to discuss each "segment" before we locked in the idea of what that segment meant. This way, I could further tailor each segment with recommended exercises from the PT.  


**Here's the prompt:**

As an expert in strength, mobility coaching, and physical therapy, specializing in mild S-curve scoliosis management, please generate workouts that adhere to the functional patterns philosophy of strength training, initially focusing on relieving my mild right abdominal wall weakness, left knee pain, and right back tightness.  

My S-curve scoliosis exhibits a leftward bend in the cervical spine and a rightward bend in the lumbar spine. It is mild and physical therapy has been recommended by healthcare professionals. I'm 33 years old, in overall great health, and comfortable with using the gym facilities available to me including a treadmill, a cable pull, a stationary bike, workout mats, medicine balls, free weights up to 35 lbs, etc. 

 Incorporate my workout preference for a blend of whole body, strength, mobility and cardio workouts and consider my main goal to alleviate the knee and abdominal pain while building up overall physical fitness and strength.  

The workouts should comprise of the following six segments: 1. Warm-up on the treadmill 2. Myofascial release 3. Stretching 4. Mobility 5. Strength 6. HIIT on the stationary bike  

These segments can be combined to create four different types of workouts: Whole Body, Strength, Mobility, and Cardio. Workout segments are always in order as they appear above  

A Whole Body workout would include all six segments. 

A Strength workout would include segments 1-3, and 5. 

A Mobility workout would include segments 1-4. 

A Cardio workout would include segments 1-4, and 6.  

Workouts can be either 45 or 65 minutes long, with each segment having a set duration: Warm-up on the treadmill: Always 5 minutes. Myofascial release: Always 10 minutes. Stretching: Always 10 minutes. Mobility: 20 minutes in a Mobility workout, 10 minutes in all others Strength: 20 minutes in a Strength workout, 10 minutes in all others HIIT on the stationary bike: 20 minutes in a Cardio workout, 10 minutes in all others  

Before you start generating responses, I'd like us to discuss each workout segment, one by one, starting with the warm-up. This will help provide further information on each segment to better tailor the exercises to my needs. When you are ready, please ask me to begin discussing the warm-up on the treadmill. 

My last piece of instruction before we begin is that whenever I request a workout, I will simply say "workout", if I forget to provide the date of the workout, please ask for the date. Also, please ask what type of workout I want if I forget to include it (ie. A Strength workout that includes segments 1-3, and 5, A Mobility workout that includes segments 1-4, A Cardio workout that includes segments 1-4, and 6.)

\---**example from the stretching section discussion**

in the stretching segment, i would like to give you a bunch of exercises that I like doing so you can incorporate them into our workouts, but you can also use these as examples of exercises to generate additional ones:   sidelying open book thoracic lumbar rotation, cat-cow, child's pose stretch, child's pose with sidebending supine chest stretch on foam roll, hanging from pull-up bar.
