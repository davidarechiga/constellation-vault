When you hold me in contempt, I feel uninvited into your space. Kept out in the rain. The more self-righteous you act, the less I feel I have a say in my existence. an alien of my own birth. third person, slipping further and further away from first person. I start feeling like I belong to an invisible world, only made of dreams. This contempt is contagious as is the anxiety. passed from word to word, feeling to feeling. It’s easy to wake up inspired but when the day is done, where has the hope been placed. your idea of perfect, help over my head, used as the ruler that is slapped across my wrist. Is it better to have never reached at all? sometimes. 

Sometimes, I don’t want to be around you. Sometimes, You make me sick to my stomach. Feeling like authenticity is impossible with you.
