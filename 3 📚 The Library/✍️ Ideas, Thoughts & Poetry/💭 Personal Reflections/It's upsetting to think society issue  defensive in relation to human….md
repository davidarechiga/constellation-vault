It's upsetting to think society issue  defensive in relation to human connection. Only until we are dug into do we find ourselves letting go. Since moving to New York, I've found myself alone in bars becoming the observant as opposed to the observed. Bartenders ask how I'm doing and I reply with the usual "I'm doing fine" when I know this a rough couple of days. A crowded bar doesn't quite set the scene for a therapist role play. Im sure the bartender actually means, "would you like another beer?" Three drinks in and this blog post justifies a fourth. I'm on my way to a As Tall As Lions reunion show in the city where they are from and all I can think "I am forgetful and purposeless." I struggle to put my flaws center stage so I can, for the first time, make New Years resolutions in hopes I actually learn how to be an adult. Reckoner plays over the loud speakers and I order my last drink. Luckily driving in the city is more expensive than my rent. Subway trains become my superman.
