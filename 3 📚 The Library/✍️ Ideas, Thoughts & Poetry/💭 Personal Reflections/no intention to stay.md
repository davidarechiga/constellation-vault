no intention to stay
every reason to leave
who am I to question
falling autumn leaves

I question everything
Trust me I'm so afraid of heights
Im betting everything in my heart
on these bossa nova nights
I want you so bad
My fingers crossing
Chance of a lifetime
Not quite often
this doesn't happen quite as often

once in a lifetime loving
chance of a lifetime love
doesn't happen too often
chance of a lifetime lovin'
