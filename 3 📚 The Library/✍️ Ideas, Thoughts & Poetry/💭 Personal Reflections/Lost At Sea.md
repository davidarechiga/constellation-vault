Lost At Sea

in a row boat, purpose is the horizon
in daytime, calm seas surround me
furious waves while I sleep
I’m afraid I’m not afraid
by the time I reach shore
who will I know
what will dreams be
its all just chemistry 
the feelings we feel
But a lot of times feelings are learned 
and habits are created from emotions made up of chemicals
they get hard to control
