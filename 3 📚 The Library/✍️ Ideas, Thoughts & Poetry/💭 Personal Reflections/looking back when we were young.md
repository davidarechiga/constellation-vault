looking back when we were young
we did whatever we wanted 
nothing to prove
nothing to lose 
nothing but you
we slept around to figure out
what we truly wanted 
something always told me it was you

in the morning I wake up next to you
i never questioned the truth
when you were done
i thought you'd just turn and run
but its you

im going all in
placin’ bets
shuffle the cards
i got no regrets 
all in
roll the dice
owing everything to your gorgeous eyes
