there is nothing wrong
it’s just me who is confused
was it a bad dream
or do i just want to forget
i’ve been following along to the news
it’s been matching up to your moods

everybody always said they knew
didn’t know shit
nobody that i fuck wit

crush me baby crush me
break me in two
why do i always run away girl
you know i would stay 
i remember way back
do you feel the same? we go way back

been a long time
and i know you wondering
How long til this kid stop wandering
