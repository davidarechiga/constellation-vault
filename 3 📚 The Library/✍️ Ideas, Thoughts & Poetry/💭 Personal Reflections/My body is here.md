My body is here
But mind is away
Gone with the wind
No, gone with the wave
Slipper slope
An Infinity time warp with an
Impossible maze
Impossible what?

Impossible days
swept up
With such effortless grace
Kept up
No, kept to myself
Tight lipped 





Just been in and out of it
Turning off and on at the flip of dime
Just been in and out of it
What would momma say if she were to see me   today
Just been in and out of it
Turning off and on at the flip of dime
Just been in and out of it
Just been in and out of it
Just been inside out and...

Gone with the wave
Like Kanye would say
