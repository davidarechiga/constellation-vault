# Stay composed, all, this isn't a trial
It's akin to a reverie, a fleeting while
Let the emotions ebb, don't rush the attack
Guilt, a deceptive cloak, often veils the fact

I observe as your form gently unfurls
Defying commands, I stray from the rules
Now filled with remorse as your eyes gently shut
White lights, as pale as your features, I can't rebut
Reclaiming you, a wish forever stuck.
