Star Wars is not a big part of my life. To be honest, it's only a part of my life by association. Sitting on the subway, I realize no one here is seeing one of the first showings of Star Wars: the force awakens. It's possible this is the only way any of us are connected (besides my coworker who I have never said hi to, let alone introduced myself.) I question the point of Star Wars. I question the meaning of Star Wars to a population, individually and in general. What makes something important and what makes something more important than something else. Somehow, through all of this chaos of entertainment, fear is overlooked. Fear slips through the cracks. It seems fear that is left unattended turns into more fear which becomes desperation. Yes, I have seem people act in desperation more than I would like and I am guilty of it but, for me, it’s understandable. In a generation of instant gratification, it seems we have issues that can’t be instantly resolved. We tend to gravitate toward childhood memories. I purchased a gameboy this week and haven’t put it down. Why? because my childhood was filled with it. I think teaching children to not only find empathy globally but also teach them to act quickly, the future will be a much better place for our children and their children.
