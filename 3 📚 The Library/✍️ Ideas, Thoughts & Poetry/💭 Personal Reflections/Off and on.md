Off and on 
I watched the clouds
As they’ve come and gone
One day they came
But never went away
History 
stuck On repeat
Everyday is a PATTERN

Constant state of
Fight or flight
With These butterflies
Been called timid
My entire life
History
Stuck on repeat
Everyday is a pattern

Have you ever laughed so hard
You started to cry?
Couldn’t stop the tears as
Life passes by
Have you ever laughed so hard
You started to cry?
Couldn’t stop the tears as
Life passes by


Let me hide behind this smile

     

Reach for devices
To help me escape my life

 



Reach for devices
To try and explain my life

Can’t get out of bed
At least 3 times a week

Feeling welcome was never my strong suit
Letting fear overwhelm me

Gotten by
On good looks
 








Nobody asked them to stick around
No matter how much I run
Still sing the same old song
