![[sunlit in the west village 150bpm BbMaj.wav]]



light hits the bricks in the west village
Reminds me of your birthday
Oh gawd I always forget your birthday

Effortless I followed you
Just to fall
Just to feel something at all
 never good at love
But I was good for you
Just a timid boy
How Did I ever catch a butterfly

Two completely different people come together
exploding in slow motion

And now
We dance

I want no one if I don’t have you


Why did I runaway
Why was I so scared
You were never afraid
You put your faith in love
put your faith in me
put your faith us
(Why do I runaway)
Sun light hits the bricks in the west village
Cheers to every year hoping we’re closer to forgiveness

Every day we praya 
Our patient sun washes this rain away
