# Under the Weather

Your skin, like knocking on a door, soft and tender
Invites me in where I am not welcome
A home already occupied 
Pull me in, then lock me out
I am yours for the taking
A door unwavering 



Like a television you turned me on and I saw the world in technicolor 
puling me  away from reality into a dream of what could be
Pressing my buttons till the show got old
Sometimes the colors will fade
