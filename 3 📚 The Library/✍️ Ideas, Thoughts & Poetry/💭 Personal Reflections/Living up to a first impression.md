# Living up to a first impression 
Never finished the last song you heard me play
Everyday I ram away
Such a sensitive subject

Will you ever be ready
Always starting over and over
Turn the lights off when you’re ready 
Always something more to do

Was it always about the the money
Never cared much about it
When I had it
Even when we ran dry

Finally I know better than to lay on the bed
before it’s time
had to forget what I learned on my own
It doesn’t fit your mold
