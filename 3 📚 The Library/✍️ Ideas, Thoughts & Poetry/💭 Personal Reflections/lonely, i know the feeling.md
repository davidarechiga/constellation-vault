lonely, i know the feeling

 we say things
to fill the empty spaces
worthless words
and abandoned places

...
he deserves all your attention
i know it's hard for you to tell 
there is something you're missing

i'm afraid to say
i'm thinking about you
but i'm thinking about you
while you are away

when time talks to me
have patience blindly
you're wearing thin
but so is everyone
where will i take what i deserved
