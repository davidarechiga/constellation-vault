camille: burnt orange
Ive been suffering
you know where I’m coming from
broken
bridges
and a firestorm


![[SuperDemo1.wav]]


stay calm everyone
this is not a test
Just feels like a dream
Let the feelings pass
Until they bite us back
Guilt is not what it seems
I watch your body unfold
I never do as I’m told
Now I’m full of regret
Just as your eyes close
White lights as white as your nose
never getting you back

Life flashed before my eyes
In a car crash
Still don’t know what was wrong
that night
only Heaven knows what 
was gonna happened
Would I have said goodbye 
if I knew it was my last time?
