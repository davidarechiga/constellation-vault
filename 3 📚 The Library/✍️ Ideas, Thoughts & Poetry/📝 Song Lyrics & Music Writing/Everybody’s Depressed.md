Everybody’s Depressed

lyrics

**Once** upon a Time I was a child
Born out of wedlock
Moved around 
In California
every couple years
Mama always said
you should get some friends
She didn’t know I had depression
neither did I

I don’t blame her for the world I built
walls invisible to the eye
Every house I’ve ever lived in
had walls
too high to climb

**in the middle of calm and chaos**
**Thread by thread we unravel**
**Revealing my thoughts and secrets**
**Always down a road less traveled**
**in the middle of calm and chaos**
**Brick by brick we dismantle**
**Revealing our thoughts and secrets**
**Our thoughts and secrets**

Trauma loop in the bath room
Of a Dingy dive
Watching the good girls
Kiss the bad eyes
Lust runs round and around
Faithful till we hit rock bottom
This is how we cope
Mixing our words with whiskey sour lips
Building relationships
We will never fix
never fix

Can we really have all that we can
Imagine
  Thinking to myself
Is there anybody out there

**in the middle of calm and chaos**
**Thread by thread we unravel**
**Revealing my thoughts and secrets**
**Always down a road less traveled**
**in the middle of calm and chaos**
**Brick by brick we dismantle**
**Revealing our thoughts and secrets**
**Our thoughts and secrets**

We all have thoughts and secrets living within us.
It’s up to us to let them through...

Will it just bum us out


Thread by thread we unravel
in the midst of calm and chaos
Brick by brick down the road less traveled



in the midst of calm and chaos
Thread by thread we unravel
in the midst of calm and chaos
Brick by brick down the road less traveled

Brick by brick we unravel
Step by step down the road less traveled
Brick by brick we unravel
Step by step down the roadless traveled
Brick by brick we unravel
Step by step down the roadless traveled
