all my dreams
take me back
to my old room

(the days that I loved you)

6am
I got the call
you weren't alright

David you better get here
We don't know how much
time is left for us

in this ever changing world
so hard to understand
how people come and go
be ready at any moment
to face the fear of the unknown

it's ok to be alone
you don't have to have a home
you just have to find yourself
work and watch the flowers grow

if i only would've know
life's not just sunsets and sunrises

now that you're gone
I searched for your love
endlessly 

(chorus)
no day passes by
you don't cross my mind

each story you told 
memories of mine

I was a kid
My heart was blind

I can't have you back
No matter how much I try and i try




silly to think about how I 
took you for granted










What was death
Safe to say I had no clue

stories I can't undo
in an old house
and the stories I've kept 


what exactly are you
trying to tell me
is this inside my head
an imagination of regret
