Nobody Smiles


everywhere I've searched
every nook and cranny
you were nowhere to be found
in this long forgotten city
I never forgot you
I can still remember every time
you stole my sweater
I always let you
whenever I was out
you were always down
you're smile got me through
girl it's safe to say, nobody's smiles...

hook:
nobody smiles like you, like you do, its you
no one can make me smile like you, its you

verse:
and you make me feel
like it's all a dream

things will never change just rearrange.
