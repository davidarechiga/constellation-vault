(verse 1)
History 
Always on repeat 
I Can’t get out of bed
At least 3 times a week
You know I’m Talking to myself these days
Talking to myself In a way I wouldn’t talk to anyone
 
(verse 2)
Memory
gone by seventeen
Prayed everyday for love
drowned in apathy
talking down on myself these days
talking down on myself
in the way you would always talk to me

(chorus)
never learned to live passionately
can’t forget these past daydreams
only learned to love desperately
and ran away from everything 

(post-chorus)
even now there’s not closure for me
using any drug to fall asleep
don’t wanna sound like a broken record
but my life changed the day i met you

(chorus)
never learned to live passionately
can’t forget these past daydreams
only learned to love desperately
and ran away from everything 

—————————————————————————

im living on the edge these days

No matter how many times I swim to shore
pulls me back again

Hold my head high
(Just enough to)
breathe in above the surface
(I'm sinking in)


Carry the weight of 10 thousand men
If you know what’s good for you
You can’t rely on anyone
And you’re not to be relied upon

Sleeping dreams away
Drowning in reverie


What does it mean? 
30 year safe
No ones able to crack it
Change comes from within
self love what is lackin

All these dreams 
Never seem to wake up
