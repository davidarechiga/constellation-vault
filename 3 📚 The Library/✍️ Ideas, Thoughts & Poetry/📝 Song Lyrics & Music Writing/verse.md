**verse**
everybody stay calm
this is not a test
and it feels like a dream
this is a disaster
unfolding before our eyes
you saw forgiveness
just before the white lights

**prechorus**
this is not a test
but it feels like a dream

choke on the words
drowned in memories
whatever works
no, whatever hurts the most
 **b**
