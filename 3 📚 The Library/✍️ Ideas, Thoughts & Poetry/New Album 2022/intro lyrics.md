nothing like your words to calm my mind
even though you’re gone you’re still around
all these painful thoughts just waste my time
no matter what they say, Stay Grounded and True

nothing like your words to calm my mind
even though you’re gone you’re still around
all these painful thoughts just waste my time
no matter what they say, Stay Grounded and True
