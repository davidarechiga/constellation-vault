Lying here today
With some words to say
You are on my mind
I got what it takes

I want to be with you
I can love you too
You are always on my mind
It's like I'm in overdrive

I want to love you
Hey hey hey hey hey
I want to show you
Hey hey hey hey hey
Just let me show you
Hey hey hey hey hey
I want to love you always
