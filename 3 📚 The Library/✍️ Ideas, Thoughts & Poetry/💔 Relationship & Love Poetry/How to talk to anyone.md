<span style="color:#000ff;">How to talk to anyone</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">Communication is a minefield but your future opportunities, success and happiness depend on your interaction with other people</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">Remember this important formula</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">THOUGHTS > FEELINGS > ACTION > RESULTS</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">Most things you fear in everyday life are not really life threatening at all, but this makes little difference to the prehistoric part of your brain. Whether the fear is triggered when you are asked to stand up and do a presentation, or when speaking to someone you don't know, or doing something genuinely dangerous, it's all the same to your prehistoric mind.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">Scientists believe we are only born with two fears: the fear of loud noises and the fear of falling. That means that all the other fears you've developed over time are learned – through observing what happens to other people, watching television, reading books and, of course, your own life experiences.</span>


<span style="color:#000ff;">SUD = Subjective Unit of Discomfort</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">When you are in a situation and you experience fear ask yourself: “How scared am I? How high is my level of fear on a scale of 0–10 where 0 is ‘It's not a problem at all, I could do it in my sleep’ and 10 is ‘I know for certain I will die if I do this’.”</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">These steps will help you measure your fear levels:</span>
 <span style="color:#000ff;">1. Remember the last time you were in the situation that you fear.</span>
 <span style="color:#000ff;">2. Visualize in your mind what you saw at that time.</span>
 <span style="color:#000ff;">3. Imagine you can hear any sounds you heard or things you remember people saying or   you said to yourself.</span>
 <span style="color:#000ff;">4. Ask yourself – “How much fear did I have in that situation on a scale of 0–10?”</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">Ways to reduce your fear or push on regardless</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">1. You might find that gaining a skill set in a particular area you fear helps you push through your fear. When you repeat the activity, the fear diminishes further and further and in most cases goes away completely. It may not get to 0, but a 1 or 2 on a SUD scale is low enough for most people to get on with life. A small amount of fear is natural and normal to most people and perfectly healthy.</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">2. Fear is based on how you think about things and, in most situations, how you imagine things playing out. One simple way of reducing fear is to imagine the situation differently. Try imagining the situation you fear in a similar way to something you don't fear. For instance, I knew my fear of public speaking was made worse because I imagined everything going wrong. By comparison, I didn't fear sales meetings, I liked them. However, with sales meetings I realized I always thought about things going well. I then used the same</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">technique with speaking, i.e. I stopped thinking about all that could go wrong, and instead developed the habit of thinking about things going well. I also noticed my inner voice was upbeat when thinking about sales meetings, but down and dreary when thinking about speaking. I changed that as well: just by catching myself talking in my head in the dreary voice then repeating the same words again but with the upbeat internal voice.</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">When you change the thought pattern, you change the feelings and the feelings are where the fear exists. It can be useful to consult a hypnotherapist or NLP specialist to help you change your thought patterns in this way.</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">NLP works by helping you change your thinking patterns so that you think about things in a way that generates a more positive emotion, or at least a reduced negative emotion. As with hypnotherapy, NLP is something that is best done with a qualified NLP practitioner although there are many techniques that you can develop and use yourself.</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">3. Another way to reduce fear, anxiety and other negative emotions is through a “body awareness” exercise that you can do very easily with a little practice. The actual process itself is very, very simple and explained in the next exercise. This is all about dealing with emotions directly – dealing at a feelings level with that fear and releasing it.</span>

<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">When you notice your mind is running away on autopilot in a stream of negative thoughts, engage your conscious mind and ask yourself “Why am I thinking this?”</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">or</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">“Why am I doing this to myself? Is it helping me? I don't have to do this right now!”</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">Become aware of any fear feeling or anxiety about the runaway thoughts.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">Follow these steps when you notice you are thinking about things incessantly or worrying about something:</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">1. Notice the thoughts you are having.</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">2. Stop yourself by bringing your attention back into the current moment – where you are and what you are doing.</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">3. Notice how your feet feel on the floor.</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">4. Notice what your arms feel like, your breathing and the noises that you can hear in the environment.</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">5. Focus as much as you can on the present moment that you are in and simply notice the negative thoughts that you are</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">having and observe them without getting dragged into them, perhaps just saying something to yourself like: “Oh, I don't need to think about that right now”.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">Or, my favourite one when I notice my thoughts running away with themselves is to simply say to myself “There it is” – not with any judgement or criticism – just an observational statement: “There it is”. In that split second when you realize what your mind is doing, you are in the current moment.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">To reduce and remove this fear feeling, follow this simple process, refining the technique you practiced in the previous exercise.</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">1. Notice when you get any sort of uncomfortable, uneasy fear feeling come up – even the small ones that might arise in normal day-to-day life.</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">2. Notice them and, when they occur, just focus on the feeling fully.</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">3. Feel it; focus on it without letting your mind run away with whatever you were thinking about that caused that fear feeling. Instead, concentrate on the fear feeling; just observe it as a sensation in your body and allow it to be there.</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">4. Don't resist it, think of it like you would an itch – you notice it as a body sensation but it doesn't trigger a negative thought cycle of doom and gloom – it's just a sensation.</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">5. Allow it to be there and simply say to yourself – “Oh, there it is: that feeling” – and as you focus on it, it will very often gradually fade away.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">When you start a conversation with someone, you never know exactly how they feel at that point in time and what mood they are in, apart from very obvious signs of course. Their mood or state of mind is one of the most important factors in how they respond to you. The response that you get to anything in life is based on:</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">Where the other person is at that point in time.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">What has happened to them recently or that day.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">What is going on in their life.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">The impact or consequence it has to them, whether real or perceived.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">What you said or did in relation to what else is going on in their life at the time.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">Adopt a positive mindset.</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">To avoid thinking “I'll either get a good outcome or a bad outcome”, instead say to yourself:</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">“This is either going to go brilliantly or there'll be an amazing story to tell people later about how I spoke to someone and got a really weird response.”</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">There is a limit to how much you can grow as a person or grow your success and happiness in life with the people you currently know. The simple fact is – most of your future success and personal growth depends on people you do not yet know. If you can work on changing your mindset and how you feel about talking to strangers, you will open up a whole world of new opportunities for yourself.</span>


<span style="color:#000ff;">Four stages of interaction</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">AIDA = Attention, Interest, Desire and Action.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">There are many things that go together to really set the scene and build the dynamics of the interaction. These include:</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">The environment.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">Your own role in the interaction.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">The role of the other person.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">Your perceived value in the situation.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">Your judgement of the other person.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">How appropriate you think it is to start a conversation in this situation.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">The risk factor involved – the risk of embarrassment, for example, or of making a mistake.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">With an awareness of the environment you are in, what your role is in that environment and your perceived value there, and having considered how appropriate it is to start a conversation, you are now ready to start the first main stage of the interaction.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">Know the Outcome You Want!</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">So what outcome do you want from this communication? Is this business or social? Is this casual or is there something else you would like to happen? Some example outcomes might be:</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">Ease an awkward situation.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">Find out some information you need.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">Connect and share experiences with someone who looks to be into the same things as you.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">Share an interesting moment.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">Get a sale.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">Meet someone who could help you.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">Get friends to agree to a trip.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">Stop a team member at work making mistakes.</span>
<span style="font-family:.PingFangSC-Regular;color:#000ff;">→</span> <span style="color:#000ff;">How about just being nice and brightening someone's day!</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">The real message here is: for the most natural way into a conversation, turn off your inner critic and seize the moment.</span>
