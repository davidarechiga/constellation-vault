Laying in bed last night
Noticing triggers
Being spoken to in a commanding aggressive voice
Triggers my self doubt causing a downward spiral of emotions.

I am often ignoring myself when I tell myself I am not happy. I tell myself I need to be alone. I tell myself I don’t deserve the few things I have. I can never concentrate because I am always telling myself I need to get out of my relationship because Camille isn’t right for me. I want someone soft and delicate. I want someone who is patient. Someone who doesn’t get aggressively frustrated. Yesterday I was feeling ok until Camille came into the room telling me I can’t leave my sweaty hockey t shirts on the ground. 

I am constantly having thoughts that I don’t belong and that I have no purpose or passion left. I want to disappear and reappear in another town.

I feel anxious when Camille comes home because of how she reacts to how things are around the apartment. I can always expect to be thrown off my mood when she comes home. Her anxiety hits me like a train and I lock up physically, mentally and emotionally. This is an often occurrence. I know she is going through a lot with applying to her PhD courses. I always forgive these actions but at what point are these repeated thoughts detrimental to my own well being. I have gone to many therapy sessions and I continually create a reality distortion field and I am not honest with the reality I am living in. I tell myself if I just keep going, It will all work out in the end but in the end, I feel I am the one who is suffering.
