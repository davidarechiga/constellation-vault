Clearly you know how to fake it
Clearly I know how to run
Love got me under the gun
Love got me under the gun

Homie said you could do better
Home girl you knew better

You’re Quick to love and laugh around
I’m quick to doubt

Whatever happens before today

I’ve been hold my m yo something from a past life

You’ve won’t the race my hearts been running from



If you want to love me
Might as well plan a bank robbery
Bank robbery
Bank robbery
