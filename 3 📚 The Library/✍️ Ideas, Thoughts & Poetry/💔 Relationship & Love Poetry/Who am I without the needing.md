# Who am I without the needing

# wall clock is ticking
second by second

Is it the ticking
That keeps me awake?
Held down the words
with so much to say


# is it your heartbeat?


Are we sinking deeper
Into infinity
Told you “I need a believer”
even when we’ve lost all feeling

Held down the words
with so much to say
with my head down
Quit your day job 
Easy to be lazy
  
so obvious to see
demons are following me
like a broken record
I have trouble falling asleep 

Calm down, ill explain
I just need a couple days
ill be myself again
with my head on straight
