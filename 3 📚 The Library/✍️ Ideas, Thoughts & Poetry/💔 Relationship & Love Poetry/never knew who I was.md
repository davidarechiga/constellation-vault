never knew who I was
Til I disappeared
Took my last damn dollar down 
To the borderline
Traded my love in for loving eyes
Shed skin, sick of this hearts disguise

Everybody has a dream
let me make that clear
Don’t wanna sell your soul?
What does it mean to you
Ever since the 7th grade
I’ve been dreaming waves



We are all forever wandering
Strangers
