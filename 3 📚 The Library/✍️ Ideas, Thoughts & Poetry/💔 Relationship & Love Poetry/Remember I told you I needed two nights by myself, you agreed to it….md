Remember I told you I needed two nights by myself, you agreed to it. 

# There are 7 nights of the week and there’s plenty of time together.

We both requested some nights during the week that we can have our time to get some stuff done and we both disregard our agreement. 

You say you
Need more nights at your place but then choose to stay at my place and then you’re not happy staying at my place.

I feel like you’re blaming me for staying at my place too many nights

You’re staying at my place when I requested to be by myself and our staying with me but then complaining you don’t have enough. 

I’m not gonna tell you to leave but you want to stay 

I feel like you’re having trouble separating those two separate nights.

I hope you don’t feel insecure when we are apart 2 nights. 

I need you to be able to be alone a couple nights a week.
