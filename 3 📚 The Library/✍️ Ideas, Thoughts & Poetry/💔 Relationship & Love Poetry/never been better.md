never been better
since I met you
been feeling this change
maybe we took it too far
but these days without you
been feeling so strange
life is what we make it
baby we can make it

I guess it's back to.neutral
back to numb
forget about the nights we turn up
go so dumb
maybe we can go back
to never even knowing
how it feels to have something growing
so much to lose but much more gain
not playing around cause love ain't a game
