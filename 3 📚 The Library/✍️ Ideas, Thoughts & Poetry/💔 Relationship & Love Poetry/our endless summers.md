<span style="color:#000ff;">our endless summers</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">forgotten</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">turned rotten</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">the many words you said</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">repeat themselves inside of my head</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">unwillingness to grow up</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">forces us to change</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">lovers become friends</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">soon enough were distant strangers</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">we talk about the past like it's all we have to live for</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">you wanted me to change</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">I never thought you'd stay</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">there were a million chances</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">I never took one to say</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">you're more than a friend to me</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">soon enough were distant strangers</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">it's just like you to run away</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">from everything you feel is unsafe</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">am I the only one</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">to be surprised</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">your eyes were home to me</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">love is a crazy thing that we can't keep.</span>
