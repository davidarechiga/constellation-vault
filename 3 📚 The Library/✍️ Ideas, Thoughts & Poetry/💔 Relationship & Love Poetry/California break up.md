California break up

2 years ago I didn’t know
Late nights and day dreams, would pass    
          me by
While I await the winter snow
I feel the age inside these bones

...I know I’m young but I still feel it.


2 years ago I didn’t know 
This city’s the one that would raise me
Living in this anonymity
This energy is embracing

.....Can you feel it??

Some people are just born with it 
Can you feel it??

I truly wish you could



CALIFORNIAAAAA
Do you miss me? 
I don’t care
CALIFORNIAAAAA
I don’t miss you 
when I’m not there


Californiaaaa
(You) Used to be my sunset sky
Californiaaaaa
Now I’m searching for my sunrise


Californiaaaaa
Wouldn’t even 
    stop and stare
Californiaaaaa
There was no life 
     Inside my air

**CALIFORNIAAAAA
You used to be my 
suga pieee
CALIFORNIAAAAA
Now I’m east Coast
Said bye byeeeee
