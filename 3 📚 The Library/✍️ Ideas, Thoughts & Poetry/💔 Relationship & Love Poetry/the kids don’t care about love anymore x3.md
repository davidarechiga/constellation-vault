the kids don’t care about love anymore x3
do the kids care about love?


for years
i was waking up alone
carrying a heavy heart
only made from stone
then you came along
started breaking all my rules
forgetting every name
of all the guys you took for fools

every war you fought was won
Breaking hearts was never enough

you are the seed in which 
a love will grow inside of me
you take away the pain
the love remains inside of me

I’ve been everywhere I need to go when I’m with you
