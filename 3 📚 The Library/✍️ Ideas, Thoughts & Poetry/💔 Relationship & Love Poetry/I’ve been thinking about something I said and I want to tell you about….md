I’ve been thinking about something I said and I want to tell you about it. We were with our friends at the dolly for your farewell (to apple party).  Rachel commented on how cute we looked as a couple and I said the first thing that came to my head: “yeah but we fight a lot.” Looking back on this moment I started to realize how much negativity I bring to our relationship. I can’t say I’m surprised although I do now feel grateful of this realization because realizing these points of negativity will help me understand how to see myself positively.


Why am I choosing to focus on the arguments?
