6/8 B

frozen you stood 
out of time
biggest mistake of your life
you settled down
I fled to the city
couldn't get you out of my mind
what's the difference
if I go now or if I go then
what makes you think it is so easy
for me to pack up and run again

I wanted to hold on
but needed to let you go
running in circles
with no place to call my own
sunsets to sunrise
3 hours ahead of time
maybe I'll see you again
who knows where this road will end

haven't you ever crossed your heart
