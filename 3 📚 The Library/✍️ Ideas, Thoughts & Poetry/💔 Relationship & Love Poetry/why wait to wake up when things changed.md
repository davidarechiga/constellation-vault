why wait to wake up when things changed
life is upside down with the same names
blank space between blank faces
time is only an eraser
time is only an eraser
time is only an eraser

why wait to wake up things changed
life is upside down with the same names
blank space between blank faces
time is only an eraser
time is only an eraser
time is only an eraser

man made heart break
they don’t tell you seasons change
moods been black and blue
Tryna get the rooftops
With a better view
