Never felt 
winds like these 
They push me around

Tell me there is a better place
With a better crowd
secret love you taught me 

Am I too old to be naive?
Too old for sticks and stones
too young to be this deep
too young to just stay home
Running from these devils
Since the day you died
You’ve been by my side    
Pushing and pulling 
You said 

It’s never too late to turn around or change your mind
It’s never too late to take back goodbyes

It’s never too late to take back goodbyes
It’s never too late to take back goodbyes
It’s never too late to take back goodbyes
It’s never too late to take back goodbyes




—————————————————

There will be a time, you said
When I won’t need you
Michelle I need you




Am I too old for broken bones
