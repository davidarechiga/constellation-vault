when i wake up
will familiar be hard to recognize
blank space between blank faces
time is the only eraser
do you open your eyes to realize
love is a blindfold
when’s the last time?




a wall we’ve been pushed upon
train after train
transfer to transfer

is my attention short enough
is forever long enough
same car different drive
