# **I want to make sense of the noise that is in my head. I often feel unmotivated and doubtful that my life is progressing and my career is progressing. I often have trouble starting tasks and prioritizing. I often feel angry in my relationship. I am often overstimulated by the world and have a hard time speaking up when I need to be alone. I want to identify the ways I restore because I am often exhausted with work and my relationship.**
