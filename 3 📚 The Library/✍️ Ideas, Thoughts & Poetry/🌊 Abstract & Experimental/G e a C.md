G e a C
watching the changing of the tides
from the shoreline 
contemplating our lives 
we're scared we'll never be anything but free
to do what we please
you know, we're just the same
rising and falling
uncertainty preys on the youth

I never wanted to be anything that wasn't me
it's ok, we're still the same as yesterday

always in a daydream
