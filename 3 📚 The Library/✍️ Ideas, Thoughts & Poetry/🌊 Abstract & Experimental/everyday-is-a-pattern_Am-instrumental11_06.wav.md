Off and on 
I watched the clouds
As they’ve come and gone
One day
They came
But never went away
History stuck on repeat
Everyday is a pattern

Constant state of fight or flight
With these butterflies
Been called (timid?) too shy 
My entire life
History stuck on repeat
Everyday is pattern

Ever laugh so hard you cry
Couldn’t stop the tears from passing you by
