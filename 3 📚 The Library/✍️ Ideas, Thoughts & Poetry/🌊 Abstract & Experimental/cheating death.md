cheating death

every other week you want a break
now I'm broken
left to pick up the pieces
every other week it's something new
you're someone different

take the time to sharpen your knives
we're at war until the dawn arrives

once you walk through the door
you'll forget about me
but i hope there's still parts
you'll think about and smile
