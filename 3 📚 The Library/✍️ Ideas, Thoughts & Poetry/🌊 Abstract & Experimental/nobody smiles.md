nobody smiles

Bb c d E F g a(dim) Bb

Verse: Bb Eb Bb G F
I knew it before I could find the words to say / when every second counts / every glance is only a hint / deep and dark secrets

nobody smiles the way that you do

I may not always know right from wrong

nobody smiles the way that you do
from the second I met you
I felt something new
I swear on our love for the beach
nobody smiles the way that you do
