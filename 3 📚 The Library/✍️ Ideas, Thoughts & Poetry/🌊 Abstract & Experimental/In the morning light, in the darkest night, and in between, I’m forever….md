In the morning light, in the darkest night, and in between, I’m forever yours. I hear you call my name. It never sounds the same. I hear you call my name. If only I could call out through the void to reach you. If only I could stretch across the depths to hold you. If only for a moment I could make two parts a whole. If only for a moment I could rest beside your soul.
