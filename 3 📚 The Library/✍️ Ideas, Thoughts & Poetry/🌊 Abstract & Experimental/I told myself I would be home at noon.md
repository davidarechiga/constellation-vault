I told myself I would be home at noon
I told myself that would make me happy
I didn’t listen and now I’m stuck
Stuck pleasing everyone else
No one truly cares about your interest
We all just look out for ourselves
But for some reason I have a hard time pleasing myself
Hard time putting myself first
Why would anyone care about my goals if I don’t care about them myself
Why is it so hard for my words to stick
Why is it so hard for me to catch up to reality.
Do I have a reality to catch up to

The misery is easier and easier to subside everyday
Pushed down deep
Maybe I’ll break like a twig
It will only take a feather of weight
