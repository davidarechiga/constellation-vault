locked away the tools of my passion
safe to say they’re better left I sharpened
they’ve become a danger to my obligations

Locked away the tools of my passion
Safe to say they aren’t serving me anymore
Lying in the dirt
Seeking forgiveness from those I’ve hurt

I was hoping you would turn around one last time

i just want a different 

anything that takes me away from you
let it disappear
so i’m empty for you
