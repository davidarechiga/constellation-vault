<span style="color:#000ff;">I've searched for love</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">and gave my all</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">You took my heart</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">that was cut in pieces,</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">you held it like your own</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">another fallen leaf</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">from the tree that's hanging all our seeds</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">It's from the ground in which we can grow. Shake the fruits off, hold on tight, can you feel my soul...</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">don't give up</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">once we lose the sun</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">we'll be staring at the stars</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">You can't erase imagination</span>


<span style="color:#000ff;">(</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">We only hope to fill our hearts with the most profound ideas)</span>
