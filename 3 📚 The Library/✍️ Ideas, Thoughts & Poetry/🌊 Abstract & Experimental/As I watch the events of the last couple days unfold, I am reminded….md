As I watch the events of the last couple days unfold, I am reminded of every black man murdered by the hands of corrupt police officers. Maybe I have been numbed by the frequency but that is not an excuse to stay quiet. Silence is a problem. Silence is a means to an end but doesn’t result in what is wanted. We want equality. I want POC to live without fear of dying or fear of Murder by police, murder by white supremacy.
