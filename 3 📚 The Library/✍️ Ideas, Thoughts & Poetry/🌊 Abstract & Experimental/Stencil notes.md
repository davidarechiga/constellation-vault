<span style="color:#000ff;">When we got just over half way, I was getting anxious to finish it. So when I was spraying the white markings for the whale body, we held down the stencil instead of taping it down like the black stencil. We ended up just taping and spraying again. We did the top fin last so the hard line of the black didnt mix with the light grey shape of the body of the whale.</span>
