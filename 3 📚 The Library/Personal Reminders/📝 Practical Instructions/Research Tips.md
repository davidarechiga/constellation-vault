# Research Tips

Jenny's pro-tips about finding a research topic: Choose a topic that 1) you're genuinely curious about, 2) is not too broad or too narrow, 3) is researchable, 4) is debatable. 👏

In sum, check out Points of View Research Center and SIRS Issue Researcher and The New York Times for topic ideas. The portals are here: https://peralta.instructure.com/courses/54946/external_tools/219   Also, Google searches can get you thinking and exploring.

In sum, when you work on your research topic, ask the who, what, when, where, and why? questions. List out words that come to mind under each who, what, when, where why. *If you do this, and email it to me, you will earn a 508A point.* 👀👍
