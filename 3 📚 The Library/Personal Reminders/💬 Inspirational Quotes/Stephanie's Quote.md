<span style="color:#000ff;">"Isn't it strange that princes and kings</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">And clowns that caper in saw-dust rings;</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And common folks, like you and me</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">All are builders for eternity.</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">"To each is given a book of rules,</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">A block of stone and a bag of tools;</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">And each must shape ere time has flown,</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">A stumbling block or a stepping stone."</span>
