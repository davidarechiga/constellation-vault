**Morning**

I am grateful to wake up.

Only I have what my special spark so I must bring it to the world.

I am in charge of how I feel and today I am choosing gratitude.

I have the power to create change.

I am what I do today.


**Afternoon**

I will not compare myself to friends or strangers on the Internet.

I refuse to give up because I haven’t tried all possible ways.

When you really want it, you are unstoppable. 

**Evening**

I am whole.

I am thankful for the people I encountered today.

I let go of any worries or concerns and give them to Omni.

Today, I did my best, and tomorrow is another day.
