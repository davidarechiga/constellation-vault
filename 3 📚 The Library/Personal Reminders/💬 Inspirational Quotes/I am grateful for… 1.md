Character Asset: Composure through life’s toughest obstacles

Intention of the day: **letting the mind “dust” settle**

it’s important to let the mind settle and not let my perception of my productivity dictate the feelings I have about myself. I believe in myself unconditionally because I have survived every challenge I have been faced with and will continue to do so until the very end
