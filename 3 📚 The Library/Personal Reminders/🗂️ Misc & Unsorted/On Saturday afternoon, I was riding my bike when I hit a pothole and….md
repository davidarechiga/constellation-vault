On Saturday afternoon, I was riding my bike when I hit a pothole and flipped over the front of my bike, flew about 7 feet and slid about 2 feet. Overall I am ok, i had a bad scrape on my right elbow, some issues with my right shoulder/rotator cuff and a bruising with slight pain in my left wrist. I was able to clean/sanitize my elbow and bandage with gauze as well as wrap my wrist which has made a difference over the last two days. I still have a little bit of issue with my right rotator cuff but I believe it to be healing. Because of this accident, it’s really hard for me to write as I am left handed, so studying has been really hard, I have an exam this week and my professor asked me to submit a doctors note in order to be excused with the score being replaced by my Final test score in a couple weeks. Would you like me to make an appointment in order to get this doctors note?
