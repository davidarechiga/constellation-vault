Intention is all around us. Having been taught to assume positive intent, I approach most situations with narrow positivity. Today, as I was walking up to the bus I saw a stopped bus with a group of people outside the front door looks my puzzled. Maybe, I thought, it's a flat tire or the bus had broken down. Turns out it was a drunk homeless man standing in the door. For no reason is this guy holding up this bus other than he can. He knows the bus driver won't hit him (it's visually apparent it takes all the bus drivers strength not to lash out.)
