Yo it’s April 14th, 
And you know what that means,
It’s Suzanne Olvey’s Birthday 
Raise your hands & scream! 

Even though they’re in Portland
And Corona’s in the air
We can still send all our love 
Just to show how much we care

Cuz this year’s real big 
You hit the big 3-0
So you better turn up
And make that booty flow

I hope your day is lovely
And you feel brand New
I’m sending birthday wishes
From me to you
