Nothing comes to mind right now. I love the things of the past. But that which has not manifested yet is very interesting, too. <span style="font-family:.SFUIText-Bold;"><b>On the other side of now.</b></span> The future. 10 minutes from now or 20 minutes from now or an hour. The concept of that is just so interesting to me. And relating back to Pink Beach, that’s the higher frequency and that place inside of everyone that has no beginning or ending. It’s just there. That’s what this was kind of about and that’s what excites me a lot. It’s the things that *don’t* exist.
