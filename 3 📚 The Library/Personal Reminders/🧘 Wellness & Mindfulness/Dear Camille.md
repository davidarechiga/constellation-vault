# Dear Camille

Out of all the little things I love about you, what makes my heart melt the most is your ability give the present moment your full attention. When we are together, it feels like time is racing by because of all the fun we have together. I know you care so much about me and our baby River because I can feel it everyday. The past 6 years have flown by so fast. From the first ferris wheel ride to picking out our wedding shoes together, it feels like an instant and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I know I can be difficult sometimes and I am so grateful for everything you have taught me so far, like how to have lasting friendships and how to speak my opinion. No other human will ever fill me with love and make me feel the way that you make me feel. I know this is our last anniversary before our wedding so this journey is just getting started. I am so excited to grow with you in ways I would have only ever dreamed of if i didn’t meet you at Croxley’s that warm summer night. Here’s to starting this magnificent journey of life together as a team and showing everyone how’s it’s done!
