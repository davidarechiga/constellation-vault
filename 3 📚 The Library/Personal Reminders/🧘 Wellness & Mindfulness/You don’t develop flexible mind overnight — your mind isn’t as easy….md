<span style="font-family:Georgia;color:#262626ff;">You don’t develop flexible mind overnight — your mind isn’t as easy to change as your outfit. You have to develop mental habits with small changes, consistently over time.</span>
 
<span style="font-family:Georgia;color:#262626ff;">Here’s how:</span>
 
<span style="font-family:Georgia;color:#262626ff;">Make a commitment, for one week, to try to let go of what you’re holding onto when you get irritated, frustrated, sad, etc.</span>
<span style="font-family:Georgia;color:#262626ff;">Make a list of the things that trigger these emotions — being interrupted, someone cutting you off in traffic, someone being loud when you’re trying to work, people not washing their dishes, etc.</span>
<span style="font-family:Georgia;color:#262626ff;">Create reminders for when those triggers happen — paper notes, a bead bracelet, something written on your hand, a sign on your car’s dashboard, etc.</span>
<span style="font-family:Georgia;color:#262626ff;">When the trigger happens, pause. Notice the emotion rising. Feel it, but don’t act. Breathe.</span>
<span style="font-family:Georgia;color:#262626ff;">Try to see what you’re holding onto — wishing the driver would be more polite, wishing you could do what you were doing without interruptions, wishing other people would be perfect in cleaning up after themselves. These wishes are fantasies — let them go. Be open to the way things are, to changes that have happened. Breathe, open your heart, accept.</span>
<span style="font-family:Georgia;color:#262626ff;">Now respond appropriately, without wishing things were different, with compassion.</span>
<span style="font-family:Georgia;color:#262626ff;">Repeat however many times you like during the week, or a minimum of once a day.</span>
