<span style="color:#000ff;">just focus on the project, dive in, hide the phone, the tv, all the distractions</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">and fall into whatever your doing to a point where time no longer exists in your conscious state</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">for seated meditation, lighting a candle in a dark room and staring into it is a great way to work on your single pointed focus</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">I highly suggest sandalwood for a great median to set the rooms mood</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">palo santo wood and sage can also be burned to clear the air and sanctify the area</span>
