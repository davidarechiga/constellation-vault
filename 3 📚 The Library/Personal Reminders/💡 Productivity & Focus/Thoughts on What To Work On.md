## Cooking
I want to make cooking a ritual, I think it’s best to do this on Sunday morning. No need to rush. No need to stress. I can make 3 dishes that can last until Wednesdayish. I can cook my favorite foods. I can also make Camille’s favorites like a ginger latte.

## Saving money
If it’s not free, really consider if it’s worth it. How much worth will come out of it. Need to focus on making money and not spending money. I have a couple different creative hobbies that can make money and I actually am skilled at creating content. This needs to be a focus moving forward. 

## School
It’s important to focus on school especially with this Asynchronous psyche class. I think this will be better on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Check when due dates are so plan ahead of time

## Graphic Design
I can make money doing something I love. Typography, layout design, imagination. I signed up for a typography class through Berkeley Art Studio that I need to make time for. Think about screen printing for spring 24

## Weight-loss and Core Building
Wow, surfing in Canggu was amazing and I really want to get back to it. I know I wasn’t the best but I was able to stand up which is more than I can say on a little while. Surfing combines nostalgia with move for water and beach life. Camille also loves it. I think Saturday mornings will be perfect for this.
