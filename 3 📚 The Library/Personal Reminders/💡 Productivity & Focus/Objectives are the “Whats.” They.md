Objectives are the “Whats.” They:

- express goals and intents; are aggressive yet realistic
- must be tangible, objective and unambiguous; should be obvious to a rational observer whether an objective has been achieved
- the successful achievement of a objective must provide value for oneself

Key Results are the “Hows.” They:

- express measurable milestones which, if achieved, will advance objective(s) in a useful manor to their constituents.
