# Loyalty

To Ron, Brooke, Leo and Brock,

I’ve known you four to be strong, compassionate, and loyal. Ron and Brooke, I see the strength you have for each other and your family. You have always shown compassion in the advice you give me and Camille, and loyal to your entire combined family trees. You are an inspiration not only as a marriage and family, but also as risk takers who have a lot of courage for activities such as running marathons and climbing Machu Picchu. I hope we all get to do something really adventurous and fun together! You make the goals you have accomplished as individuals as well as a team look effortless and Camille and I can’t wait to see what you do next!

Here are two children’s books I think everyone will adore and 6 months of audible for both of you.

Thank you for hoeing me kindness and accepting me into your family! Can’t it to see you at at our wedding.

Sincerely,
David Arechiga
