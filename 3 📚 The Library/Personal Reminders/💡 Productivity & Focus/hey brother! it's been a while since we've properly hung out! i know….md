hey brother! it's been a while since we've properly hung out! i know i really haven't asked you for utilities because i originally told steph utilizes were included for $900 but then shortly after agreed $800 was ok cause she couldn't really afford 900. i realize now that paying the $300 for utilizes every month was too stressful for me and was wondering if you could help out? also: i just wanted to say that you moving out is more emotional for me than i anticipated. i really haven't said anything cause there is a lot going on but i felt it was necessary to address. i hope it wasn't something i did but more you found a great situation that will lead to more happiness. Eli seems like a great fit for you. although i don't know her very well, she has always been pleasant. i don't plan for this to be goodbye but a welcoming of new opportunities.
