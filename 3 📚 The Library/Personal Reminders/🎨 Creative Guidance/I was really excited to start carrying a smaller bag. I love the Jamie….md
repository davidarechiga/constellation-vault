I was really excited to start carrying a smaller bag. I love the Jamie xx bag I got from JCREW. Totally a great purchase. Too bad it rained so I didn’t feel comfortable taking the smaller bag because I didn’t want to get all my stuff wet. The backpack is great because it is water resistant but for the most part, it’s really extra. It’s possible I don’t like it because my upset back is kinda weak so I’m always hunched over. Pilates class was really great because I got to work out my core. Definitely need to do this more.
