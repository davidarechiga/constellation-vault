Business Vs Consumer PC


I've had to explain this so many times to managers who want to cheap out and buy "Aldi PCs" that I almost know this by heart.

What is the difference between business PCs and consumer PCs?

Platform features

Business grade devices have features either default or as option that consumer PCs don't have. This includes

•	⁠TPM chips (for Bitlocker)
•	⁠SmartCard readers
•	⁠PXE boot capabilities
•	⁠firmware support for virtualization and firmware security like SMM mitigations
•	⁠Thunderbolt
•	⁠A guarantee that your system's MAC address and SMBIOS GUID is unique
•	⁠Automation options such as updating firmware and setting BIOS settings unattended through scripting in a standardized way, rather than having to do it manually on each device. Imagine having a fleet of 10k devices and having to update the BIOS on all of them by going machine to machine with a USB stick. With business grade devices you just script and automate this so that a single person can do it with a proverbial push of a button. Driver updates have similar tools to automate.

Support

Consumer grade devices' support pretty much tapers off when the next model launches. Business grade devices will get driver and firmware updates for years, which is important for stability and security reasons.

Business grade devices also come with options where you can bypass Tier 1 support of the OEM and reach engineers directly. (with Dell that's pretty much ProSupport).

Warranty options

Consumer grade devices come with one year warranty (or two if you're a EU resident). Extending this is sometimes not even possible.

Business grade devices come with multiple years of warranty. You can of course pick how many years, but the norm is minimum 3 and can easily go up to 5 if you want.

Some OEMs, like Dell, also have fully integrated "accidental damage" warranty options that cover things like broken screens and whatnot.

Platform configuration stability

It is well documented what components a specific business grade model contains, or what limited different kinds it could contain in case of RAM or SSDs or so. That set of components remains fixed for the entire lifetime of the model.

In fact, if you're big enough, you can ask OEMs to build devices with single specific components so that all of your devices of a single model are exactly the same. This costs extra, but the option is there.

Consumer grade systems can change internal configurations whenever the fuck they want, there is not much consistency not a guarantee of consistency.

Platform lifecycle length

For consumer devices, when the next model launches, the current model immediately ceases production.

In business gradei devices, the old model remains in production for another 3-ish months, allowing you time to test and validate the new model while still being able to purchase the previous one should the need arise.

Platform configuration flexibility

Consumer devices come in a few fixed SKUs and that's it.

Business grade devices still operate on a "build to order" principle, where you can pick and choose what CPU, what RAM, what disk size, etc. Yes there are certain fixed SKUs per region that you can order "off the shelf", but you don't have to.

Build quality

While yes there are cheap feeling devices even in business grade devices, all of them are tested for at least "business ruggedization", meaning they are meant for multiple years 16/5 constant usage, and can for example survive a drop from desk height (because a user forgot to unplug their headset again when walking away...)

An extension of this is basically the general component quality, you'll always either have "quality" components as standard or at least as an option. An example here would be Intel based LAN and WiFi controllers.

Logistics options

There's a lot of configuration and logistics options business grade devices offer if you want it.

Want the machines to be shipped from the factory with your own version of the OS install? Can do.

Want a neat excel sheet that contains the details of every device in your order, from serial nr to MAC address to other details? Can do.

Want BIOS settings customized to your specification straight from the factory? Can do.
