**Clean install of windows 10 OS on new SSD-best procedure for eliminating current windwos 10 OS on old hard drive**

Don't try to copy the old OS from the HDD, it is much better to clean install Windows 10 on the SSD

If you do not have Windows 10 Installation Media Click [HERE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10) to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 4GB) using that tool or create the ISO file which you can later burn to DVD

**Once you have the bootable installation media created:**
1. Shut down your system. remove the old HDD and install the SSD *(there should be only the SSD attached to your system during the installation process)*
2. Insert the Bootable Installation Media
3. Go into your BIOS and if SATA Mode is not set to AHCI, change it
4. Change the boot order so the Installation Media is top of the boot order
5. Save changes to BIOS and Reboot your system
6. The Installation should start
7. During the installation process **skip the steps which ask for a product ke**y and select the option **'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC'**, and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Servers
8. During the installation process, your system will reboot, at that point, you may need to go into your BIOS and change the boot order so your system boots from your Hard Drive, otherwise the installation may start all over again - *do not remove the installation media at this point*
9. When Window 10 has finished installing and the desktop appears, shut your system down
10. If you have a second HDD bay install the old HDD into it and start your system
11. Make sure you can see both drives in Windows File Explorer, if not you may need to restart a couple of times for Windows to recognise both drives
12. Install any required drivers (can be obtained from the support page on the Website of the manufacturer of your system
13. When your system is up and running,
- copy your data *(files, images, music . . . etc.)* from the old HDD into a temporary folder in the SSD
- format the old HDD and name it Data Drive
- copy the files back onto the old HDD
- Delete the temporary folder from the SSD

That's It!
