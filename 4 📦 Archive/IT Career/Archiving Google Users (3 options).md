# Archiving Google Users (3 options)

1. Archiving mailbox externally (offline on external hard drive or SSD) via export tool and deleting the user

2. Transferring emails to an existing user (for example: to the admin user) then deleting user

3. Converting User to an Archived User where the cost is less.

Without talking with google support via their account, I won’t know the specific details of cost.
Google support will also be able to answer the couple of questions I can’t answer looking on the internet.
