$2999
8bay 64TB about 50tb usable

Hey Parker, hope your day is going well, this is what I’ve come up with to meet your needs.

For 5x16TB @ $269 per drive ($1,349.95 total) and an 8-bay open box enclosure from OWC for $538.75, we are looking at $1,898.70 before setup labor cost. This enclosure will be super fast at 40Gb/s speeds but will not be network attached so really just for one user. It will also have to be next to the computer. These drives can be configured in a RAID 5, 5 16TB drives will result in about 64GB of usable space. RAID 5 will have a fault tolerance of 1 drive so one drive can be lost and the data will still be intact. We can add one more drive for RAID 6 and your fault tolerance jumps to 2 drives with the same usable space. You will also have 2 extra bays for future expandability. This is using renewed drives and an open box enclosure to save money. If you wanted brand new drives, these ones are $309.99 Let me know what you think or if you have any questions. I believe this is all in stock. This enclosure can also be locked and locked down with a locking cable for security purposes
