# Question 1: Building your first Game - What Tips could you share with others?

One tip that for building a game is that pre-production is more important that the production or post-production phases. When you brainstorm with your team (or yourself), everything will fall into place and you will not waste any time/resources down the line when those "brilliant" ideas don't end up working out. Pre-production is about developing ideas so you minimize any future risk of starting over. It's all about diversity of ideas and iterating past the initial ideas. Basically, You may think sketching out ideas is a waste of time, but in reality, it will save you hours/days in production/post production time. 

Another tip is to never say no to an idea. You will never really know if an idea is good or bad until you see it through until the end.  
# Question 2: What do you think is the best console / game system EVER?! And Why?

The best game system ever is the Playstation 3 because this is when games finally started to become vessels for emotional storytelling for me. Some examples of this are The Last of US, Grand Theft Auto IV/V and Metal Gear Solid 5, The Phantom Pain. The Last of Us was a monumental turning point for video games, not only in gameplay mechanics but also in graphics and storytelling. 
# Question 3:The Lens of Emotion: From either of your game proposals so far, what EMOTIONS did you want the player to experience - and why?

In Galaxia, we had the intention of having the player feel empowered to solve the case and rescue the Alien Olympiad children/young adults who were being taken advantage of by the shady coaches while also feeling satisfied with the concept of running a business as an immigrant in a foreign land. I believe we wanted the player to experience these emotions because these are stories that don't get told as odten as they should. I truly believe that the best to learn how to be human is to put yourself in the shoes of others who don't look or act like you.

# Question 4:The Lens of Essential Experience: From either of your game proposals so far, what is ESSENTIAL to the EXPERIENCE of the game?

For Pizza Madness, it was essential for the player to experience healing through feeding. Interest trolls are toxic  because maybe they were not given all the attention they needed as a child. No one showed up for them when they called for help so they because dark and cruel. Pizza madness allows you to help them by feeding them.
