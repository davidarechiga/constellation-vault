deeper thoughtful listening
just because someone says they are fine, they might not be. people are often saying much more than the words that come out. When you listen thoughtfully, you are able to perceive emotions the person is feeling.

game design is an interconnected process so understanding the five kinds of listening is very important

In the first chapter of The Art of Game Design, Schell answers a very important question, "How do you become a game designer?" with a very simple, "Design Games." Schell uses a simple answer to help the reader understand that confidence plays a major role in making video games. He goes on to say that you will fail over and over again but this will be the journey and it's important to learn to love to fail. This means the more comfortable you get with failure, the easier it will be to brush them off and progress closer to success. I think this matters because self-doubt can be so powerful no matter what stage you are in your career. 

Although there are many skills like "engineering, mathematics, music, psychology, public speaking, sound design" that will make someone a good game designer, Schell says listening is the most important skill. Listening is the most important skill because when designing a game, you will need to communicate effectively with your team, your audience, your game, your client and yourself. This means you need to have open and honest conversation about progress, bandwidth and mental capacity. This matters because if you have an open lane for communication, you able respond without blame, judgement, or excuses. 

The last part of chapter ones goes over the minor gift and the major gift. This refers to either natural talent or love for the art. There is a perception that natural ability allows someone to do great work without much effort but, in reality, loving your work is far more important because it allows you to sustain practice and keep getting better over many users.
