1. What is my favorite Brainstorm technique from the chapter? Why? 
My favorite brainstorming technique by far is to mix and match categories because most of the time you will end up with an idea that is completely fresh. I love the idea of writing lists of different components like how we did the Matrix game ideas exercises. I feel this is a great way to start the brainstorming process because you will immediately have a variety of different options to start with and you can start the iteration process fast. 



2. Propose a NEW (or different) Brainstorm technique - What’s good about it?

A different brain storming technique I would recommend is implementing constraining in the prototyping process. I do this with music all the time. For example, when I want to be creative, I give myself a constraint of only using drums to make a song. This means I am not able to use any melodic or harmonic elements in the song. This has me thinking in a completely new way as I mostly write songs on piano. When I constraint myself to just drums, I get a completely different style of music and pushes in me a creative direction. This also really helps to unblock me if I'm feeling like my ideas are stale.
