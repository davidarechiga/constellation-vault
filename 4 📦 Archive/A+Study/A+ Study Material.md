## Missed Questions 6/30/2020
- What is likely to be reset during standard printer maintenance?
	- Paper and Tray settings
		- Printer maintenance might have the effect of resetting the printer’s paper tray settings

- Lois is working on a user’s bluetooth headset. She tried a number of fixes, none of which worked.What should she do?
	- Research the problem on the internet
		- When a problem gets challenging, a tech should research the problem.

- What would cause a laser printer to generate a totally black screen?
	- no power to the primary corona
		- with no power to the primary corona, toner will be transferred to the entire drum, creating a totally black sheet.
		- with no power to the transfer corona, the paper would be blank. if anything a malfunctioning laser would cause a lighter image not a darker one.

- Len is nervous about outsiders accessing his home network. which of the following could he use to control access?
	- MAC Filtering

- Janice's onsite call is almost funny - the laser printer is spewing pages like crazy. The customer begs "Janice, stop this 4300 page printer job!" Which of the following is the most elegant solution?
	- Clear the print spooler

- In laser printer technology, what occurs during the writing stage of the image formation?
	- The Print image is written to the drum
		- the laser strikes the drum in the areas that are to be printed, giving those areas a less negative charge. This makes these areas relatively positive, so they attract the toner.

- Margarita has seen plenty of System setup screens over the years, but when she presses DEL at boot on her new laptop, she sees two password options: "Setup" and "System." What are the more common terms for "Setup" and "System," respectively?
	- Supervisor and User
		- Some computer manufacturers use the terms “Setup” and “System” rather than the classic terms "Supervisor" and "User," but the options still perform the same functions.

- Android smartphones are different from other smartphone devices in that:
	- Android devices use open source operating systems
		- Android uses open source operating system. Open source refers to a program in which the source code is available to the general public for use and modification from its original design free of charge. Since open source can be modified, it is not proprietary.

- What is the function of the charging circuit on a laptop?
	- Charges the battery
		- The charging circuit charges the battery.

- Kevin has just installed a LED-backlit LCD display. Which of the following is true about the native resolution of a digital display?
	- It provides the best quality display
		- When you set your display to use the native resolution, that means you are going to use the resolution that is was created for, which means it will provide you with the best quality image it can produce.

- A technician, trying to upgrade the RAM in a laptop, opens the bottom of the case to discover that there is only one RAM slot when there are supposed to be two. Where might the other slot be?
	- Under the keyboard
		- Laptops sometimes hide the second RAM slot under the keyboard.

- A client has asked you to recommend a printer. She wants to print multi-part point-of-sale forms. The client is not particularly interested in the quality of the printer's output, but emphasizes the importance of printing receipts in triplicate. What type of printer should you recommend?
	- Dot Matrix
		- Only dot-matrix printers are able to print forms in triplicate, because they are impact printers and actually strike the paper.

- Intermittent lockups and reboots are most likely caused by ___________.
	- Failing Power Supply
		- Failing power supplies are a major cause of intermittent lockups and reboots.

## MEMORY RAM
- DIMM
	- Dual inline memory module
	- electrical contacts are different on each side
	- 64 bit data bandwidth
- SO-DIMM
	- Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module
		- About half the width as a DIMM
	- DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4 SDRAM
	- Used in Laptops and mobile devices
- Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)
	- The memory on the DIMM
	- Dynamic
		- needs constant refreshing
		- without refreshing, the data in memory disappears
	- random access
		- any storage location can be accessed directly
		- unlike magnetic tape
- Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM)
	- SDRAM is synchronous with the common system clock
		- queue up on process with waiting for another
		- classic DRAM didn’t wait for clock signal
- Double Data Rate (DDR) SD RAM
	- **184 pin**
- Double Data Rate 2 (DDR2) SD RAM
	- **240 pin**
	- Faster Speeds
		- Twice as fast as DDR
	- Not backwards compatible
		- DDR2 won’t work in DDR slots
- Double Data Rate 3(DDR3)
	- **240 pin**
	- Twice the rate of DDR2
		- Larger chip capacities - Max 16gb per DIMM
	- No backwards compatibility
		- peed brings sacrifice
- Double data rate 4 (DDR4) SDRAM
	- Speed increases over DDR3
		- Faster frequencies
		- Max 64gb per dimm
## Memory Tech
- Multi-Channel Memory
	- Dual-Channel, triple channel, or quad-channel
	- Increases performance
	- Memory combinations should match
		- Exact matches are best
- Memory that checks itself
	- used on critical computer systems
- VM servers, database servers, any server
- Parity memory
	- Adds an additional parity bit
	- won’t always detect an error
	- can’t correct an error
- Error Correcting Code (ECC)
	- detects errors and corrects on the fly
		- detects errors and corrects on the fly
		- not all systems use ECC
			- it looks the same as non-ECC memory
- Parity
	- Even Parity
		- the parity bit makes an even number
	- Valid or Error?
		- Even parity byte
