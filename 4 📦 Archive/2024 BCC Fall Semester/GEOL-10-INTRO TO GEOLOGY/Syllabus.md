**Description:**

Geology 10 is an introduction to **what Earth is made of**, **Earth’s origin and evolution**, **Earth’s structure**, and **how the Earth works.**  A major theory is the notion of **plate tectonics** resulting from circulation (convection) in **Earth's mantle** driven by **residual heat and radioactivity in the core and mantle**.  In the Bay Area we live on a major **transform plate boundary**, a situation lending itself to interesting local field trip opportunities!  We will explore the three basic types of **plate boundaries** (transform, divergent, and convergent) and the **volcanism, earthquakes, and rock**s associated with these **plate boundary** types.  The class will also consider major **rock types** and the **rock cycle**.  We will also discuss **why the Earth is habitable to life** as we know it.

**Grading:** your final score will be based on four course components (scores 15 +55+15+15), as described below**:**

**Homework:**

Online homework will be turned in via your **Smartwork account** and will be done by yourself without collaboration.   Homework will form **15% of your grade**.  Details of homework are given for each week (chapter) of the class; **you must complete homework on 8 out of 10 chapters to pass the class.**

**Tests:**

There will be **a 25 % point mid-term take-home test** and **a 30 % point final test.**    There will be no make-ups for tests.   Missing the mid-term or the final test results in an F for the course.  This component will make up **55% of your grade**.

**Field Trips:** 

Three semester weeks will be used for field trips to nearby localities of geological interest.  After all, we live on a major plate boundary and amongst amazing geology!   Two are remote and one may be self-guided if COVID permits.  Field trips and field trip reports (**you must do 2 out of the 3**) will make up **15% of your grade**.

**“Attendance” Policy – Participation score**

You are expected to complete each week of class and field trips, and participate in the assigned exercises, discussions, and questions.  **Occasionally there will be a short quiz or mini-project, covering the most recent material.  15% of your grade** will be based on class participation which includes attendance (doing each week’s task) and evidence, including completion of online homework, that you are actively involved in Geology 10.`

**Final grades** will roughly follow these guidelines (the instructor reserves the right to slightly adjust the boundaries):

A 100-85 %; B 84-70 %: C 69-50 %; D 49-40 %; F = 39% or below.  If you complete all of the assigned work, you stand a chance to get a good grade. 

**Learning Strategy:**

Geology addresses the fundamental nature of Earth history, what the Earth is made of, and how the Earth works.  Since we cover a lot of material in a limited amount of time, the following steps are highly recommended:  

**1) Get tutoring help from me** if you need it 

**2) Look at the “Chapter Summary”, “Guide Terms” and “Review Questions”** before reading a chapter 

**3)** Attempt problems and read the material before listening to the lecture so that you have questions**.  Learning is more efficient if you approach each week after reading some material.**  

Use the book to learn the easy material and use me to help you master the more difficult concepts.  

It is highly recommended you spend **3-6 hours per week on geology,** depending on your needs**.**  If you seriously put in as much or more time out-of-class than in-class (listening to the lectures), you will likely get a good grade and learn useful information about geology.  

**Learning outcomes for Geol 10:**

1. Describe the three plate boundary types and their connection with volcanoes and earthquakes, including types of volcanoes and earthquakes. Recognize zones within Earth.  _Assessment Method:_ Essay questions as part of exams/quizzes; forum discussions (group discussions)
2. Summarize the geological and plate-boundary configuration of California and the Bay Area. _Assessment Method:_ Problem solving short answer questions; essay questions as part of exams/quizzes; forum discussions (group discussions)
3. Define and distinguish the three major rock families.  Summarize their origin and typical mineral compositions.   _Assessment Method_: multiple choice exams and quizzes; essay exam questions.

**Recommended Course Schedule** -  This is suggested to help you keep up during the course, but you don’t have to follow these dates/deadlines as the class is asynchronous – **however, you must get the 2 tests in on time**.

**RECOMMENDED COURSE SCHEDULE: Geol 10, Fall 2024 –** **only the two tests have a fixed due date!**
