### Geologists
- scientists who study the earth
	- remote deserts
	- high mountains
	- damp rainforests
	- frigid glaciers
	- deep canyons
### Why Study Geology
- what is geology: study of the earth
- earth is constantly having natural disasters related to geoscience
- gives an awareness of the planet
- puts accomplishments and consequences of human civilization  in a broader context
	- Geological Phenomena greatly exceeds human made structures but man and destroy earth faster.
- study geology will hopefully spark curiosity when viewing the world.
### Geology Tools
- basic tools are hammers and hand lenses
- there are more sophisticated measuring tools out.
### themes from the text book
#### Geology incorporates insights from many sciences
- uses key concepts from physics, chemistry and biology
#### the earth has an internal structure
- The earth is homogeneous inside but consists of concentric layers
#### the outer layer of the earth consists of moving plates
- Top layer of the earth's crust is called the **Lithosphere** and this surrounds a softer part of the mantle called the **Asthenosphere**. Distinct boundries separate this shell into discrete pieces called **Plates**
- Theory of Plate Tectonics
#### we can picture the earth as a complex system
- The earth is not static.
- Earth's interior, solid surface, oceans, atmostphere and life all interact with one another dynamically
- This interconnected web of interacting realms of materials and processes is called Earth Systems
#### the earth is a planet
- Earth is formed like the other planets of the solar system
- Earth is different by having plate tectonics, an oxygen rich atmosphere, a liquid-water ocean and abundant life.
#### internal and external processes drive geologic phenomena
- ##### Internal Processes
	- Driven by internal energy, heat from inside the earth
	- Plate movement is an example of this.
		- mountain building
		- earthquakes
		- volcanoes
- ##### External Processes
	- driven by external energy
	- solar energy
- **Gravity** plays an important role in both internal and external processes
- The interaction between internal and external processes froms and shapes mountains, canyons, beaches and plains
#### The earth is very old
- Earth formed as early as 4.56 billion years ago and no later than 4.54 billion years ago
- **Geologic time** represents the duration of Earth's history.
#### The geologic time sale divides the earth's history into intervals
- 
#### geologic phenomena affect society
- Volcanoes, earthquakes, landslides, floods, groundwater, energy sources, and mineral reserves are of vital interested to every inhabitant of this planet
#### physical aspects of the earth system internet with life processes
- Without the physical earth, life could not exist but without life, this planet's surface might have become frozen wasteland like that of Mars or a cloud-enshrouded ocean like that of Venus
#### the earth has changed dramatically in many ways over geologic time and continues to change
- Over Earths' history, the planet's surface, composition of the atmosphere and sea level have all changed.
#### most of the resources that we use come from geologic materials
- oil, gas, coal, metal, concrete, clay, fertilizer and other materials.
#### geology helps you visualize your surroundings in four dimensions
- Time is the 4th dimension 
#### science comes from observation and people make scientific discoveries
- Science does not consist of subjective guesses or arbitrary dogmas but rather of a consistent set of objective statements resulting from the application of the scientific method. Every scientific idea must be tested thoroughly and should be used only when supported by documented observations.

#### Scientific Method
1. Recognizing The Problem
2. Collecting Data
3. Proposing Hypotheses
4. Testing Hypotheses
5. Theorizing

#### Practice Questions
##### Concept A: Geologists utilize a vast array of tools to study our panet.
1. List the tools and methods that can be used during geologic studies. What Questions do geologists ask during this work?
	- Geologists use basic tools like hammers and hand lenses
	- there are more sophisticated measuring tools out.
	- They also use the scientific method
1. What insights into the evolution of features on the earth might scale models provide?
##### Concept B; Geology addresses interesting academic topics and helps solve many practical problems
3. Define Geology and lost topics that it encompasses. List Examples of News Headlines that pertain to geologic issues.
	- Geology is the study of Earth and the Earth System. This encompasses Geologic Phenomena like Volcanoes and earthquakes, plate tectonics, weather systems 
4. What are examples of practical issues that geologic study can address?
	- how to keep pollution out of groundwater, how to find oil and minerals, and how to avoid landslides.
5. Identify the events or activities illustrated by Photos A and B.
	- A: Aftermath of an earthquake that destroyed a building
	- B: an excavation site

#### Concept C: Many Themes serve as the overall take-home message of introductory geologic study.The theory of plate tectonics, the Eath System concept, the expanse of geologic time, and the role of geologic features and phenomena to society stand out.
6. Identify the internal layers of the earth shown in Diag A. How does the crust differ from the lithosphere?
	- Crust, Lithosphere, and asthenosphere
	- ![[Pasted image 20240909194212.png]]
1. What is the basic premise of the theory of plate tectonics? On Map B, what do the arrows represent?
	- The outer layer of the earth consists of separate plates that move in respect to each other, causing different phenomena.
2. In Diag C, which arrows represent internal energy and which represent external energy?
