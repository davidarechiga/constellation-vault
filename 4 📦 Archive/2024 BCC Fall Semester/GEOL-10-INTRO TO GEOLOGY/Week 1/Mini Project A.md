[A Tale of Two Hurricanes Finds More That Differs Than Is the Same](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/us/hurricane-milton-helene-florida-north-carolina.html)


This article starts off with first hand accounts of the destruction caused by Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. Hurricanes are becoming more powerful due to climate change, effecting areas that would not normally be hit by hurricanes. Areas like North Carolina are hard to support because they the topology is so mountainous and the infrastructures are not built to hold up a category 4 hurricane like in Florida. In Asheville, most people are still without power and water. Most roads will need to be replaced with flood-resistant infrastructure. In Florida, Milton hit just two weeks after Helene. In the overall scope of things, Florida was much more prepared to handle the waves of hurricanes, sending out alerts well before the hurricanes touched down and started evacuating it's residents near the coast. This happened to be very effective as only 14 deaths are attributed to Milton vs the 234 deaths attributed to Helene.
