Jude, a jazz musician

Jude, a jazz musician, is **playing** on the street corner of canal and st. peters in New Orleans, Louisiana for the first time. After he is done playing for the night, he **explores** the neighborhood, **finding** an old acquaintance amongst a crowd of college. It had been years since Jude had seen this person. Jude **breaks** the tension with a light smirk and question, "wanna get out of this hipster college bar?" Jude's friend smiles and nods in agreement. They stop at the corner store to grab a bottle of wine and **sit** along the shore, making wishes on falling stars.
