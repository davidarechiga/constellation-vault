During call and response, one musical or lyrical phrase is answered by a contrasting phrase. West End Blues, third chorus, Louis armstrong

Found in nearly every type of African America music that exists

#### Rural Blues
Blues was born in the southern US and the Mississippi delta was particularly fertile area for the development of blues
Different styles emerged as blues artists migrated areas
Often provided the soundtracks for underground activities such as gambling bootlegging, and prostitution. Unsavory reputation

One of the earliest styles of blues was born in the Mississippi Delay called Rural Blues

Favored spoken instructions and endings, strong “on the beat” phrasing, unamplified guitar and relative freedom in the formal structure of the songs and texts.

Almost always male who accompanied themselves on guitar
In Texas, Blind Lemon Jefferson developed single-line guitar techniques and musicians from the Miss Delta such as Charley Patton and Robert Johnson typically had a heavier more intricate style of playing

Robert Johnson, often regarded as one of the most virtuosic performers of the rural blues style, only recorded 29 songs during his lifetime. 41 if counting alt takes
Deeply troubled and short life also suggest what many people would come to associate with a blues lifestyle, hard drinking, womanizing

1936 and 1937 show Johnson’s rural blues style as it’s best.

There were limited rural blues songs made in 1920-30s doe to the face that record companies were not interested in recording, let alone marketing. Largely survived an oral tradition rather than through recordings. 

Folklorist - scholarly interest in researching and preserving music that is part of oral traditions. usually traditional to specific regions or groups.

Early 20th, big push to travel and capture these lesser known blues artists.

Leadbelly is a prime example of music that survived due to Folklorists.
Named after gunshot to stomach
Lived a rough life of violence, drink and frequent imprisonment
Father-Son folklorists got him out of jail several times, presented him in concerts and clubs and recorded for library of congress
Leadbelly often served as the lead singer for the prison gang work songs that were so essential for coordinated effort in breaking rocks

Work songs, 12-bar blues and folk songs, such as
Irene GoodNight
Cotton Fields
And Black Betty


#### Urban Blues
Like rural blues, typically follows the 12-bar blues form with blue notes and call and response

Mostly female singers backed by solo piano or a small combo
Often resembled Dixieland jazz groups in their personnel like trumpet, trombone, clarinet, piano, guitar, and bass

They would perform at vaudeville but became successful so they were able to leave vaudeville and begin new careers performing Blues

Bessie Smith - one of the most powerful female blues singers of the 1920s, recorded 180 sides for Columbia records between 1923 and 1933 backed by saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, Trombonist Jack Teagarden, and other big league jazz performers.
Called, Empress Of the Blues
Recorded Backwater Blues, an original composition in response to the flood of Cumberland River, accompanied by pianist James P Johnson, Smith demonstrates great emotional depth while employing standard blues elements such as blue notes.

Many urban blues recordings were released as race records, the music industry term for recordings that were produced by and/or marketed toward African Americans. race records considered a separate genre and included nearly all genres of African American music. Labels included OKeh, Emerson, Vocalation
A majority of race records were released as a division of a major white-owned record label.

Race Records eventually became Rhythm and Blues in 1949.

Many companies initially rejects singers like Sammie Smith, Bessie Smith and Ma Rain because they did not approve of their, unpolished” vocal style, southern dictation, and raspy vocal timbres. Labels wanted pretty and lyrical (read: White) voices and singers.

In  August 1920, Mamie Smith recorded “Crazy Blues in the OKeh studios in Ne York. Smith was a vaudeville performer at the time and Crazy Blues was penned by her follow vaudeville performers Perry Bradford. Surprising, the tune sold over 75,000 copies in the first month and opened up a big market for a while field of urban blues singers.

Victoria Spivey, Sippie Wallace, and Sara Martin followed at OKeh, ALberta Hunter, Ida Cox, and Ma Rainey came out on Paramount. Bessie Smith and Clara Smith recorded at Columbia and Tricia Smith performed on the Black Swan Label.

Mamie Smithm Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey often sang about southern sensibilities, men and sexual relationships, they also presented themselves as refined, glamorous celebrities. Stars, dressing lavishly with Jewels, fancy gowns and feathers, live performances were a sense of luxury and opulence.

#### Boggie Woogie
Boogie woogie - eighth-note obstinate patterns generate a driving rhythm in the left hand while the right hand embroiders that pattern with a variety of highly ornamented melodies.

Pinetop Smith - Pinetop’s Boogie Woogie
Shows off these repeated bass figures and rhythmically contrasting right-hand melodies

Meant for dancing and it was a staple of Chicago Rent Parties (if someone couldn’t pay their rent, they would host a party where pianists would come and place and everyone would throw in some money to help)

#### Commercial or Arranged Blues

Much like ragtime inspired Tin Pan Alley Songs, Blues inspired many popular Tin Pan Alley songs.

Most prolific - W.C. Handy
Churned out dozens of blues inspired songs in the 1910s. His campaign song for E.H. Crump’s mayoral race became famous “Memphis Blues”. Several more blues compositions followed and in 1914, St. Louis Blues” took the world by storm, darling of Tin Pan Alley, called father of the blues but more accurate to say father of arranged blues

St Louis blues started a national craze fo this new type of blues music.
