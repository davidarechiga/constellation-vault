Jimmy Rodgers; some original “hiccuping” vocal style; sounds a bit like yodeling; note that  
country music is, to some degree, a combination of blues, anglo/celtic folk songs, and German/Polish  
polkas; “Blue Yodel” : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEIBmGZxAhg ...lyrics here:  
https://genius.com/Jimmie-rodgers-blue-yodel-no-1-t-for-texas-lyrics  
Now check out some traditional German folk music; listen to the first song with the yodeling and  
then briefly scan the rest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FrG3EZAPZs  
DeFord Bailey; WSM and George D. Hay; Bailey was an important figure not covered in the  
eText: https://www.wideopencountry.com/the-incredible-rise-and-sudden-decline-of-deford-bailey/  
A documentary on Hank Williams; it presents some eye-opening information on the genesis of  
country music in terms of it’s relationship to country blues; first 5, then at 8:00-9:25; Rufus Payne is the  
blues musician who taught Williams: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ0SuDdhUS4  
Scan this podcast transcript for the sections “Hank Williams” and (Ralph) “Peer”; if you have  
time, you can listen to the whole think (48 min), but it isn’t required: https://points-

Hank Williams with added bass; the old microphones used to record the original version didn’t  
pick up the bass, which uses the alternating “polka” bass-line heard in most tunes in the German folk

Gene Autry movie scene with fiddle and dancers “Back in the Saddle”; Autry was the one early  
country star who had crossover success in film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5F-O_19lSI  
...lyrics: https://genius.com/Gene-autry-back-in-the-saddle-again-lyrics  
Gene Autry “Ghost Riders in the Sky” from the movie of the same name; this film (and many  
others) was filmed around Pioneertown, CA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRV6JszMXoo  
...lyrics: https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858985273/  
If you ever head out to Joshua Tree National Park, I recommend a visit to Pioneertown, just north  
of Yucca Valley, and stop by Pappy&Harriet’s Cantina, a famous music venue that has hosted artists from  
all over the world: https://pappyandharriets.com/history/  
Lefty Frizzell singing this country classic in 1959; the song expresses a common theme/trope in a  
lot of American music about a wrongfully accused or righteous criminal; the story was based on a two  
true stories: 1. A newspaper article about a famous trial. 2. A mysterious veiled woman who brought roses  
to the grave of Rudolph Valentino. Note that although Johnny Cash (covered in the Rockabilly lesson)

Lesson 8: Traditional Pop in the 1940s and 1950s  
Things to think about from the eText:  
Frank Sinatra  
The Riot in Times Square  
Your Hit Parade  
Crooner vs. Swooner  
The Ink Spots vs. The Golden Gate Quartet  
Overdubbing  
Boswell Sisters vs. Andrews Sisters  
Harpsichord  
Songwriters of the 40s and 50s Pop  
Performers with TV shows  
The section on traditional pop in the 40’s and 50’s is one of the longest chapters that we will  
cover. Don’t overlook the practice quiz questions under the Test Yourself drop-down on the top of the  
screen in c4e. Quickly skim the listening in the Discover Music section, but focus your energy on the  
links directly imbedded in the text.  
One key thread that is shared by most of the notable performances from this era: note how this  
music represents a shift away from the improvisational spirit of jazz towards a more highly polished  
product with a very high production value. It is one of the last eras that you can still clear ties to jazz  
tradition that led to the development of American popular music. The obsession with perfect execution  
has led to where we are today: artists on some the biggest stages (think Super Bowl) are expected to lip-  
synch their own performances.  
In terms of eras, this represents a transition from the Ziegfeld Follies live show to film; Lucile  
Ball in 1943, a tribute to the follies; note that the music is similar to the Star Trek theme, although it  
predates it by two decades; Ball would go on to be the executive producer of Star Trek:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LhtNEmNkuY  
Ink Spots with Ella Fitzgerald; doo-wop meets jazz; “Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall”:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9IaplRrm4 lyrics: https://genius.com/The-ink-spots-into-  
each-life-some-rain-must-fall-lyrics  
Golden Gate Quartet “Jericho”; doo-wop meets gospel:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMohuzLl6UU ...lyrics: https://genius.com/The-golden-gate-  
quartet-joshua-fit-de-battle-of-jericho-lyrics  
Patti Page solo; the version in the text features great overdubbing (she recorded all of the dubs),  
but this version holds it’s own; “Tennessee Waltz”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVsJsooSN2Q

Boswell Sisters “Rock and Roll” 1934, 20 years before it was a genre:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b5oWwFUhN0 ...https://www.metrolyrics.com/rock-and-roll-  
lyrics-the-boswell-sisters.html  
Connee Boswell had a vibrant solo career; she was paralyzed from the waist down; note how they  
hide it in videos such as “Falling Star”; lyrics are in the captioning for the movie scene:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQcTiUq5TlE  
Andrews Sisters “Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy”; many of their tunes had military themes during  
WW2; many students recognize this one from the Fallout video game series:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfWc52smNs8 ...lyrics here: https://genius.com/The-andrews-  
sisters-boogie-woogie-bugle-boy-lyrics  
*The Ross Sisters are not covered in the eText, but this is one of most memorable performances  
from this era; note how perfectly the music matches the action during the extended instrumental section:  
do you thing the music was written first, or was the scene filmed first? This whole clip is emblematic of  
this era, where elements of classical and jazz are fused into a perfectly crafted product:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1J3NLNWAPU  
Nat King Cole briefly had a major network TV show; some key cultural background:  
http://www.classictvinfo.com/TheNatKingColeShow/  
*The Hazel Scott show predated Nat King Cole’s, although it suffered a similar fate:  
https://narratively.com/this-black-woman-was-once-the-biggest-star-in-jazz-heres-why-youve-  
never-heard-of-her/  
NKC instrumental piano solos; he was a great piano player:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCEcDhF2LSo  
NKC with Eartha Kitt (one of the original Catwomen on Batman from the 1960s) “Careless  
Love” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHbSovVeH_4 ...lyrics: https://genius.com/Eartha-kitt-

Read this article about Kitt, who was targeted by the CIA at one point:  
https://timeline.com/eartha-kitt-white-house-89411992a367  
Frank Sinatra on “Your Hit Parade”. Be sure to read about this show in the text; “Stardust”; note  
that while the song was written at a Tin Pan Alley hit in the 1920s, it was Nat King Cole who was the one  
to repopularize it; this “Your Hit Parade” version was true to form, where they brought a popular artist to  
cover another artist’s hit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F13JswrYwMM

Here is another brief Quincy Jones interview with some rare footage and pictures with Sinatra:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tjuwJZbP_E  
Sinatra “Fly Me to the Moon”; as mentioned in the Quincy Jones interview, a recording of this  
song was taken to the moon by the first astronauts; this version, arranged by Jones, was done in  
conjunction with Sinatra and the Count Basie Orchestra:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2rDb4Ur2dw ...lyrics here: https://genius.com/Frank-sinatra-  
fly-me-to-the-moon-lyrics  
Doris Day and Frank Sinatra “You, My Love”; many of the artists in this era worked together:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSkIcXM3og ...lyrics: https://genius.com/Frank-sinatra-you-  
my-love-lyrics  
Rosemary Clooney “Mambo Italiano”; This tune is an interesting case of cultural appropriation,  
as the writers/performers had nothing to do with Mambo or Italy: it was written in an Italian restaurant  
during a brief Mambo craze in the 1950s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9prJXEhNhPA  
Perez Prado in a Zoot Suit; part of the Mambo craze in the 1950s; “Pachuco”:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy7ep9e6qNo  
Read this short article on the Zoot Suit Riots in the 1940s:  
https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/zoot-suit-riots  
Cha Cha Cha; 1942; this tap dancing performance by Elenor Powell, who danced with Fred  
Astaire, among others, is billed as “the best tap dancer and drummer in the world”; the performance is  
emblematic of the level of perfection that is shared by many performances during this era; as with the  
Ross Sisters’ performance, do you think the music was recorded first?  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R8InADno6o  
A young Tony Bennett, known for “I Left My Heart in San Francisco” and still performing today,  
performing “Young, Warm, and Wonderful” live: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbjaFYyG5gE  
...lyrics here: https://genius.com/Tony-bennett-young-and-warm-and-wonderful-lyrics  
Unfortunately, the Tony Bennett segment from 2021 on 60 minutes has been pulled from  
Youtube. If you do a search, it is on Paramount+, although it is only available for subscribers so it isn’t  
required.  
Perry Como and Martha Davis on the Perry Como Show (1956) singing the old Tin Pan Alley  
classic “I’m Going to Sit Right Down...”, by Fats Waller; Davis gets a pass in the book, but I recommend  
exploring other performances in addition to this one:

Louis Jordan “Caledonia”, 1946. To me, this sounds like early Rock & Roll:

Rhythm and Blues Crossover  
Fats Domino was one of the first “crossover” artists; initially, the term crossover meant music  
that “crossed” lines of racial segregation “over” to white audiences:

Chuck Berry’s “Maybelline” was based on “Ida Red”:

“Roll Over Beethoven” Chuck Berry’s tune actually may have been written by his pianist, Jonnie  
Johnson, who later tried to sue him; The Beatles covered it seven years later:

Ironically, one of Beethoven’s last compositions (1821/1822) had elements similar to boogie;

Gospel  
Older Gospel; Mississippi John Hurt; notice that this song uses the term “Alleluia”, used in  
religious services for over a thousand years; this song features call-and-response elements found in the  
blues; “Since I’ve Laid My Burdens Down”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXEtNknolKY  
...https://genius.com/Mississippi-john-hurt-since-ive-laid-my-burden-down-lyrics  
Thomas A Dorsey, the creator of modern gospel, tells the story of why he wrote one of the first  
modern gospel songs, “Precious Lord”; remember him from the chapter on Blues? He was the piano  
player on Ma Rainey’s “Deep Moaning Blues”; fast forward to this essential interview from 15:30-20:00:  
https://youtu.be/atlG3O3UwA0?t=924  
Mahalia Jackson warming up the crowd for Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech in  
Washington, 1963; Notice that the crowd is clapping on the 2nd and 4th beats of a four beat measure: this  
is the same thing as the “backbeat” in rock and roll; Jackson worked with Dorsey at the inception of  
modern gospel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9iQUIwAgus ...lyrics here:

Mahalia Jackson, “Trouble of the World”; this clip is from the 1959 movie, “Imitation of Life”  
(highly recommended): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsJFqW1zhsk ...lyrics:  
https://genius.com/Mahalia-jackson-trouble-of-the-world-lyrics  
Although this is only tangentially related, the original 1934 version of Imitation of Life is  
arguably just as good as, if not better than, the 1959 version with Mahalia Jackson. Check out this riveting  
clip from the original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5XUOtYk3Fk  
Josephine James version of “Stand By Me” is covered in the eText; note that the original version  
by Charles Albert Tindley dates back to 1922; this is the gospel tune, not the R&B classic by Ben E.  
King: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC109ihcbak ...lyrics, and note the other artists who  
covered this tune, including Elvis Presley:

One the musical elements brought into the popular music fold by gospel singers was the  
“melisma”. A melisma is when a singer sings multiple notes on a single syllable. Here is a composite of  
melismas (multiple notes sung on a single syllable) in modern pop music; they are often called riffs/runs  
in pop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8iJ6SCH6rU

While melismas in modern pop come from stylistic elements found in early gospel music,  
melismas have been around for at least one thousand years; how many notes are sung on the “ia” syllable  
at the end of “Alleluia”?: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FUCZl9dytM (...cont)  
Gospel to Rhythm and Blues  
Ray Charles, “What I’d Say”; Ray took gospel music elements, removed the religious lyrics, and  
added early R&B rhythms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAjeSS3kktA ...lyrics here:  
https://genius.com/Ray-charles-whatd-i-say-lyrics  
Modern/Current Gospel  
Norman Hutchens’ version of “Jesus is on the Mainline”; while gospel has informed late popular  
music (melismas/Ray Charles/Hutchens, etc), it has also borrowed a lot from R&B, funk, and rock&roll,  
an interesting feedback loop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuGe6aoIA6I ...lyrics here:  
https://genius.com/Norman-hutchins-jesus-on-the-mainline-lyrics  
For perspective, here is the oldest version of “Jesus is on the Mainline” that I could find; recorded  
by Alan Lomax in 1959; as mentioned in a previous chapter in the eText, these Lomax recordings can be  
found in The Library of Congress: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns8bum4civI
