This is a summer semester so everything is condensed into a third of the time each class is going to require about 8 to 10 hours a week of focus which means about 25 hours of work per week

It is best to get started early in the week so that I have plenty of time to revise and submit towards the end of the week. I am not taking much vacation this summer.
