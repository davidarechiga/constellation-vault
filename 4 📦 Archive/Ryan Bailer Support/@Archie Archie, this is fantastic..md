@Archie Archie, this is fantastic.

So, the  questions we want to resolve before we move forward are below. Most of these are just double and triple checking to make sure.

1.	once the client has the Spectrum app AND Spectrum Internet set up on the Apple TV, should the stations show up automatically within the app, or does it take 24 - 48 hours for them ALL to show up?



2.	does the client have to subscribe to Cloud DVR service separate from the Spectrum GO account, or is Cloud DVR included in the Spectrum GO account? (DVR specific to streaming, not DVR for the cable box)


3.	can the client STILL use the cable box DVR feature, so they can record on their cable box as well as the Cloud DVR?



4.	confirm one more time that ALL the channels in the Spectrum GO account are included in the app (we’ve seen differently for other clients, and even spoke to Spectrum about it and they’ve said that not all channels are included in the streaming service



5.	confirm one more time that the client CAN record ALL stations via streaming (cloud DVR recording). We’ve been told by Spectrum as recently as a few weeks ago that some stations cannot be recorded. 



6.	last quetison that I just thought of now: is there any connection between the cable box DVR and the Cloud DVR? Meaning, if the client recorded a station on their cable box in the bedroom but they want to watch it on their Apple TV Spectrum app in the exercise room, can the Cloud DVR access that, or is the Cloud DVR and cable box DVR completely independent of each other (I assume the latter, but who knows!)
