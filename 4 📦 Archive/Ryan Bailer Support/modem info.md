Recap:

Google Home Nest wifi is setup properly and there is a strong coverage around the house. 99% of the speed tests from the google home app were in the 800-900 MB/s down range. Placement could be modified for certain Nest nodes so the back outside area behind the garage gets a stronger signal (but still was getting 600-700 MB/s down.) There is a small nook right outside the kitchen that I would recommend putting the kitchen nest node in. Andy’s Bedroom Nest node was offline (probably just unplugged) but it could not be located so I was unable to bring it back online. Speed test showed about 600MB/s down in the bedroom. Once the node is found, we can make sure it gets back online and the backyard might have stronger signal. I didn’t have any problem moving through the house with Wifi.

Apple TV: Plugged in bedroom apple tv and instructed Andy on how to change the input to be able to watch his channels. He was mostly concerned about Netflix which we got working. Living Room Apple TV was not working so I unplugged it and plugged it back in and was able to get it to work. Made sure the HDMI-CEC was on so the apple TV remote would turn on the TV for ease of use.

Speaker system: After talking with Nicole, it seemed like HomePod minis around the house would be a great solution as they would link up to the apple TV as well as easy to use and relatively inexpensive to an actual home audio/video solution (which would be difficult to use and the installation process would be very invasive.) They had mention the devices should be off the ground but somewhere they couldn’t get damaged. They also mentioned the louder the better. If HomePods are damaged, they can be relatively inexpensive to replace and I am concerned the HomePod Minis might not be loud enough. Nicole said they aren’t interested in Sonos because it may be too difficult to use. A less fragmented speaker system would be much better and easier to use. Nicole said they did not have Alexa devices in this house.

Need to setup a time to talk with Ryan to figure out the best solution and once we do, we can order the new products.
