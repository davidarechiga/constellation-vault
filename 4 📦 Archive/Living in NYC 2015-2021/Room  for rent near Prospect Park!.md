Room  for rent near Prospect Park! 


Our roommate is moving out with his gf and we're looking for someone to take over his year lease starting June 1st.

The room costs $825 + utilities which are roughly $60-100 a month depending on the season. 
You'll need to put down a month's rent for the security deposit when you sign the year lease which starts June 1st. You'll need either a guarantor or proof of income when you put in the application. 

Regarding the room up for grabs, it has awesome lighting and a decent sized closet with shelving above. It's spacious enough for a full sized bed and dresser or a queen with some storage beneath. There is also has a fire escape outside the window to chill on if you ever feel like some quick fresh air. There is no central A/C but the pictured window unit may be for sale, the price is negotiable. 

As far as the common area goes, we have a pretty spacious living room with a pull out sofa bed and have central heating. There is a washer and dryer in unit as well as a dishwasher!! We like to keep the kitchen and bathroom area pretty clean so we're looking for someone who is willing to do the same. We're on the 3rd floor of a walk up but there's roof top access with a dope view directly above our apartment. Living in the city has its perks. 

We'd like someone who is chill, doesn't often bring the party home, is respectable,   has a steady job, pays rent on time, and is down to hang out over a beer every now and then. 420 friendly. Male or female is fine but no couples, please. 

It's located in Prospect Lefferts Gardens off of Nostrand and it's about a 15 min walk to the Prospect Park B/Q train and less than a 5 min walk to the 2/5 Train at Winthrop or Sterling. The apartment is within walking distance to the Brooklyn Museum / Botanical Gardens and Prospect Park itself. We're surrounded by great Caribbean spots, juice joints, and a few coffee places.   The area is fairly quiet as far as night life but it's only a cheap Uber to Williamsburg or a 30 min ride into the city. 

Please message me on Facebook with any questions. I will be having an open house on Tuesday May 9th from 1-3pm & 7-9pm but am also available during the week.
