When I was living in New York, I found I loved taking candid photos of people in the middle of an action. Sometimes the subject was just about to bite into a messy smash burger or slamming down a check mate in union square. Often times I’m shooting with a 50mm lens which I think is perfect for street photography because it allows you to stand outside a subjects comfort zone while still getting a close up angle. I really like taking photos so close up that you have to take a second to understand what you are looking at.
