World War I

A memorable photo from the WWI section of the video is a photo of a soldiers destroyed body laying in the foreground with more decapitated bodies and a blown up wagon in the background. This is memorable to me because it shows the horrors of war. 

A memorable photo from World War II is a photo where there are a bunch of people standing with their hands on their hips looking at each other next to a train car with 10s of dead bodies laying on it. For these people standing there, the dead bodies were not a horrific sight but just normal everyday loyalty for their country.

The photo of Thich Quang Duc on fire is one of the most memorable photos in history let alone of the Vietnam War. This moment captured is heart breaking but also shows the world the depth of desperation and protest the Buddhists against the Diem regime's persecution in South Vietnam.
