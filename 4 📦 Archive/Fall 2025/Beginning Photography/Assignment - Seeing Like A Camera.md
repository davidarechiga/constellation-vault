When I am photographing, the three elements I consider depend heavily on the reason the photograph is being taken. The three following considerations will be in the context of hobbyist street photography as this is my primary reason for photographing and where most of my experience comes from. These top considerations are in order from least prioritized or most prioritized for me.

**Consideration #3 - Documenting A Moment (What story am I wanting to capture?)**

When I am out taking photos, whether it is in my hometown or a new environment I am visiting, understanding the moment and story I am capturing is important to me. My goal when capturing the world is to help people connect by revealing the aspects of living that are universally shared by all humans on earth. Just as a song has the ability to transcend time and culture, a photo has the power of transcending language in the same way. 

**Consideration #2 - Background Vs Foreground (Depth of Field Decisions)**

Is the subject the chef or the duck? When I was on my honeymoon in Bali, my wife had booked us a tour through a farmers market where we went to pick out food to learn to cook later i the afternoon. I ended up forgetting my camera but thankfully had my phone. After walking through most of the market, taking photos of the locals, we can across a woman preparing ducks to sell. Because we were following the tour, I only had a split second to decide if I wanted the background in focus (the chef) or the foreground in focus (the raw duck). Ultimately, I thought it was more important to capture the raw duck because of the texture of the duck skin. I figured the story to capture the duck and it's journey rather than the chef because the blur of the knife was all we needed to tell the story of the chef.

**Consideration #1 - Framing, Edges, and the Golden Ratio.**

Whether you are shooting wide, close-up or somewhere in between, I think the most important aspect of shooting a good photo is how the subject is framed in the context of it's environment. I mostly use the rule of thirds and the golden ration to capture my photos. This gives the illusion of movement even if the photo is still. I want the eye to be dragged as it were on a rollercoaster through the photo at which the end is the main subject, the climax of it's story. Although this isn't always possible, when captured right and there is no space wasted, the viewer subconsciously understands the proportions of the elements and it's hierarchy.
