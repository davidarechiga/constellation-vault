I believe this photo has good composition because there are multiple points of visual interest that sit at different depths of the image, there is a nice framing around the top with the buildings and bottom with the large dirt floor creating a natural stage in the center of the buildings. The line of flags that are hung between the roofs create a ceiling which makes the photo feel smaller and The primary subject is slightly right of center on the horizontal axis and just below center on the vertical axis. This puts the primary subject at the center of a golden ratio. My eye naturally swings rhythmically from the blue tarp in the bottom left to the next blue tarp in the background. This starts the golden ratio, following the sharp lines of the architecture down to the windows with children, finally ending at the kids seated in front of the building watching the main subject. The photo is very colorful which generates a festive energy but not in a distracting way. The children are organized in such a way that creates a narrative as they are engaged with the person holding up their hand, leading the event. I can feel it's a sort of cultural celebration at school.
