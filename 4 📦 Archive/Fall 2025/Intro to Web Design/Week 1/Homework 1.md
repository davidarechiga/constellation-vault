Homework I

The video on the History of the Internet covers two main topics.

1.  Create a document (word, google) 

2.  Write about a topic/ historic reference during the 1st video that you found interesting, research it further and provide a paragraph (4+ sentences) that detail your research. 

Something discussed in the first video I found interesting is the speed of innovation, specially the fact of transistors in a microchip double every year. It brings to mind the book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. In this book, they mention that if you were to take a human from the year 1000 AD and transplant them into the year 1500 A.D., not much would be different as societal organization, technology, and basic life patterns would be largely unchanged. It wasn't until the scientific revolution that humans started to admit they didn't know everything and were relying on observation more than tradition. After the scientific revolution, life as humans knew it started to change. Transplanting someone from 1500AD to the year 2000AD is a much more exponential growth. With the advent of the internet and now social media, transplanting someone from even 1950 to the year 2025 is an even greater exponential growth and I don't see this slowing down any time soon.

3.  Write about a topic/ historic reference during the 2nd and 3rd video you found interesting, research it further and provide a paragraph (4+ sentences) that detail your research. 

A topic I found interesting in the second and third video was Enquire Within Upon Everything as I had never heard of this book before this class. Released in 1856 during a growth spurt of middle-class families eager for self improvement, it became one of the most popular guides for domestic life in the Victorian Era. In this book, you would find house tasks like laundry and servant management, cooking, health tips, social etiquette and handling legal matters. Not only was this great insight into Victorian life but also a major precursor to the self-help genre, information democratization, and the tiktok-ification of learning in bite-size portions. Although there are many parallels between Enquire Within and our modern day internet culture, what is different is the evolution from single-minded curation to a more broadened crowd-sourced algorithmic distribution.
