## From Textbook:
### Module 14.2 Personality Traits
- Psychologists want to study personality to predict individuals behavior
- Studied in two ways
	- Nomothetic Approach
		- seeks broad, general principles of Personality
	- Idiographic Approach
		- Intensive Studies of Individuals
		- looking for what makes someone special
#### Personality Traits and States
- Trait
	- consistent tendency in behavior, such as shyness, hostility, talkativeness
- State
	- temporary activation of a particular behavior
- Both are descriptions and not explanations
- 
#### The Search For Broad Personality Traits
- Trait approach to personality
	- people have consistent characteristics in their behavior
	- example: Belief in a just world
		- maintain that life is fair and people usually get what they deserve
	- The way someone acts in one situation prives a clue to how that person will act in other situations
##### Issues in Personality Measurement
- behavior is not entirely consistent
- Americans rate themselves higher than average, british are more modent and asaian even more modest
- friends probably rate more accurately
##### An example of Measurement Problems: Self Esteem
- Self-Esteem
	- the evaluation of one's own abilities, performance and worth
	- people generally have high self esteem but it's hard to measure
	- should we be concerned about women's reported low-self esteem
#### The Big Five Model of Personality
- 18,000 words filtered down to 35 from 1936 to 1965
- words were then grouped in the Big Five personality groups
- aka Five factor model:
	- emotional stability
		- tendency to minimize unpleasant emotions
		- opposite is neuroticism
	- extraversion
		- tendency to seek stimulation and to enjoy the company of other people
	- agreeableness
		- tendency to be compassionate toward others
	- conscientiousness
		- tendency to show discipline, to be dutiful
		- and to strive for achievement and competence
	- openness to experience
		- tendency to enjoy new intellectual experiences and new ideas
- each correlates with many personality dimensions for which our language has a word
- non of these traits correlates highly with any of the other four
	- not measuring same thing
![[The Five Facotrs Model of Personality.jpg]]
##### Limitations
- many psychologists fault the big 5 for overlooking sense of humor, religiousness,  sexiness, thriftiness, conservativness, masculinity-feminimity, and snobbiness
- 
#### The Origins of Personality
##### Heredity and Environment
- positive correlation for twins but little correlation for adopted children
- unshared environment
	- aspects of environment that differ from one individual to the another even within a family
- no identifiable gene with a major effect on personality
- Parents and Children extraversion are moderately correlated
##### Influences of Age, Culture, and Cohort
- 3 years old are similar people to 26 years old
- personaility change rate slows down as we get older


## From Lecture:
### A History of Abnormal Psychology
- Definitions of Mental Disorders
- Past Theories about causes of mental disorders
- current theories about the causes of mental disorders
#### Abnormal / Mental Disorders
- people are doing things that do not fit the norm
- neurodivergent
- also called mental illness
	- a display of undesirable thoughts and behaviors that is significantly different from the average interferences. 
- mental disorders are linked to body disorders
#### Causes of Mental Disorders
- historical cultures had little to no idea of where they came from
	- came up with their own ideas
##### Prehistoric
- linked mental illness to demons or magical beings
- Shaman typically helped people with mental illness
	- trepanation
		- cutting holes into the heads of people to let the spiritual beings out
		- ![[Pasted image 20231130201528.png]]
- Egyptian Perspective
	- dramatically changed the perception of the treatment of mentally "ill"
	- still magical and religious in nature
	- developed first known mental hospitals and mental physicians
		- spiritual training
- Greek Roman Culture
	- still spiritual but also talked about the body
		- balances out a persons system
		- 4 humors:
			- Black bile
			- yellow bile
			- blood
			- phlegm
		- imbalances caused mental abnormalities
- Dark ages (Monotheistic View)
	- return to prehistoric
	- still existent today
	- chasing demons out through creating inhospitable environments
		- chained
		- starved
		- flogged
		- immersed in hot or cold water
		- etc
	- still inklings of exorcisms
	- Trepanation
- Illness theory
	- later viewed as madmen or sick and taken to hospital
	- these hospitals also housed criminals, epileptics, beggars and the elderly
	- most patients were
		- chained
		- separated from contact of any sort
		- given beds of straw
		- given no means of cleaning themselves or of relieving themselves in a sanitary and private manner
		- put on display
- Philippe Pinel (1745-1826)
	- Put in charge of Parisian hospital system in 1793
	- he questioned the system in general
	- removed chains and gave them exercise and fresh air
	- worked directly with patients which eventually led to the idea that you couldn't catch specific disorders and that people could be cured
- After Pinel
	- many researchers and theorists started to propose that our social environmen played a large role in mental disorders
	- proof:
		- lack of spreading disease
		- stress related differences
		- societal factors that can be linked to certain disorders
			- anorexia and bulimia example
-  Newer Cognitive Models of Disorders
	- The Bio-Psycho-Social Perspective
		- Biology, Psychological and Social all are related and play a role
