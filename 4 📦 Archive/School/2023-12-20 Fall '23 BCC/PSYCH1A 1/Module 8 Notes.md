# From Textbook: 

## Module 13.5 Interpersonal Influence
- People Set norms
### Conformity
- altering ones behavior to match other peoples behavior or expectations
- most people will go along with the crowd
- Conformity to an obviously wrong majority
	- In Asch’s steady 37 of 50 participants conformed to wrong answer at least one and 14 participants conformed to wrong answer most of the time
	- conformity’s influence is strong but limited.
	- you are more likely not to conform if you have an ally 
- variation in Conformity
	- many similar studies have been conducted since
	- when researchers use the same procedure in different cultures, they may not be testing the same psychological processes 
	- southern Asia are often described as collectivists
	- US and other countries called individualists

### Obedience to Authority
- The Stanford prison experiment 
- young well educated men quickly abused power when given
- The milligram experiment
	- two adult men arrive at the experiment
		- one participant and one confederate
	- a teacher and learner
	- the teacher asked questions to the learner and if they were wrong, to deliver a shock.
	- of 40 participants, 25 delivered shocks all the way up to 450
	- everyone how continued beyond 330 persisted all the way to 450w
	- why did so many people obey orders
		- the experimenter agreed to take responsibility 
		- teachers saw themselves as the experimenters assistant
- regulations were established after milligram’s experiments
- psychologists are now more sensitive to the ethics of research
- must have informed consent
- even now, most people followed orders that might hurt someone

### Group Decision Making
- group decisions are generally better than individual decisions but the outcome depends on circumstances
- Group Polarization
	- if nearly all the people who compose a group lean in the same direction on a particular issue then a group discussion moves the group as a whole even further in that direction
- Group Think
	- when the members of a group suppress their doubts about a group’s decision for fear of making a bad impression or disrupting group harmony
	- overconfidence by the leadership
	- underestimation of the problem
	- pressure to conform
- groupthink is not easy to avoid

# From the presentation:

### Social Influence
- change behaviors in the presence of others
	- norms
		- standards on everyone in a specific situation
	- what pushes people
- Conformity to Ambiguity
	- there is no true appropriate behavior or responses in most social situations so we look to the group or leaders in order to act
- autokinetic effect (Muzafer Sherif)
	- suggestion that the light move but it never actually moved.
	- people reported the light moving just on the basis of the task
- what about unambiguous 
	- Asch’s line of study experiments
		- 1/3 of participants conformed  to the wrong answers
	- this was a breakthrough on why we conform
- why do people conform
	- don’t want to stick out and get weird looks
	- truly believed they were wrong
	- normative social influence
	- private acceptance
- factors that impact this effect
	- presence of an ally decreased conformity
	- push for rapid response increases
	- if people are incentivized for being corrected, this decreased conformity
	- in-group versus out-group
		- more likely to confer with in-group
- bystander effect
	- people are more likely to not do anything when there are other people around that could also do something.
