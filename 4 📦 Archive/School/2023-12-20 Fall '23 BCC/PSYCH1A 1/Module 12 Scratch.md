Criteria is interesting to me, specifically the mount of time. 
	GAD
		symptoms must be present for 6 months
	Panic Disorder
		panic attacks must occur several times for at least 1 month and worry about future panic attacks
	Phobias
		Although not mentioned in the lecture directly, the DSM states a sixth month duration must be passed in order to consider a fear a phobia.
