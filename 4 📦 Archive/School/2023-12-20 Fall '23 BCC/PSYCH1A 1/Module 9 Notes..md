## From Textbook:
### Module 14.1 Personality Theories
- Are people good or bad by nature?
- Sigmund Freud: People are born with impsuses that must be held in check if civialzation is to survive
- Carl Rogers believed that people seek good and noble goals after they ahve been freed from unnecessary restraints.
- Personality
	- **all the consistent ways in which the behavior of one person differs from that of others, espeically in social situations**
#### Sigmund Freud and the Psychodynamic Approach
- Freud lived from 1856-1939
- Developed Psychodynamic theory
	- relates personality to the interplay of conflicting forces, including unconscious ones within the individual
- most psychologists are highly skeptical of Freud's theories
- influence not as far reached as the mainstream populous things
##### Freud's Search for the Unconscious
- Freud and Breuer teated a young women and talked about her pasted causing catharsis
- catharsis
	- a release of pent-up emotional tension
- It was later showed that this had no benefit from the talk treatment
- regardless of if this helped or not, freud started seeking a talking cure
- called it psychoanalysis
	- his method of explaining and dealing with personality based on the interplay of conscious and unconscious
	- even though psychoanalysts still remain loyal to Freud's methods and theories, views have changed and diversified over the years
- central to Psychoanalysis is freud's concept of the *unconscious*
	- a repository of memories, emotions, and thoughts, many of them illogical, that affect our behavior even though we cannot talk about them
- often gave bad advice that was harmful and gave patients drugs that were not apart of the program
##### Changes in Freud's Theory
- lost the courage to defend his theory
- Oedipus Concept
	- when he develops a sexual interest in his mother and competitive aggression from his father.
- He really had no evidence here
##### Stages of Psychosexual Development in Freud's Theory of Personality
* Psychosexual Pleasure
	* all strong pleasant excitement arising from body stimulation
* libido
	* psychosexual energy
* Fixation
	* continues to be preoccupied with the pleasure area associated with that stage
* Stages:
	1. Oral Stage (Age Birth to 1 1/2 )
		1. the infant derives intense pleasure from stimulation of the mouth, particularly while sucking at the mother's breast
	2. The Anal Stage (Age 1 1/2)
		1. they get psychosexual pleasure from the sensations of bowel movements
	3. The Phallic Stage (Age 3ish)

	4. The Latent Period (Age 5 or 6 until adoesence)

##### Defense Mechanisms Against Anxiety
- defense mechanisms
	- the ego defends itself against anxieties by relegating unpleasant thoughts and impulses to the unconscious mind
