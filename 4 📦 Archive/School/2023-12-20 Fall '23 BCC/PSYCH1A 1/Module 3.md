## Module 4.1 Vision

- The discovery of how vision works was the first research discovery in psychology
- **Stimuli** - energies from the world around us that affect us in some way
- **Receptors** - specialized cells that convert environmental energies into signals for the nervous system
- **Electromagnetic spectrum** - the continuum of all frequencies of radiated energy
	- Gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet, visible light and infrared, radio, TV Transmissions
- Detecting Light
	- Structures of the eye
		- Pupil - adjustable opening
		- iris - colored structure on the surface of the eye surrounding the pupil
			- Vitreous humor - clear jelly like substance
		- Retina - a layer of visual receptors covering the back surface of the eyeball
		- Cornea - a rigid transparent structure on the surface of the eyeball
		- Lens - flexible structure that varies it’s thickness
			- Enables accommodation of the lens, adjusting it’s focus for objects at different distances
		- Fovea - central area if the human retina
			- Adapted for detailed vision
			- Greatest density of receptors
			- More of the cerebral cortex is devoted to the fovea
	- Visual Rceptors
		- Cones
			- Adapted for perceiving color and detail in bright light
			- 5 percent of the receptors are cones
				- Sends more axons to the brain than rod receptors
			- Cone responses dominate the human visual cortex
			- Cones are mostly in the 
		- Rods
			- Adapted for vision in dim light
			- Nocturnal animals have mostly rods
			- Responds to faint stimulation better than a cone
			- Rods pool their resources
			- Rods are mostly in the periphery
	- Dark Adaptation
		- Gradual improvement in the ability to see in dim light
		- Rods regenerate faster than Cones in dim light
	- The Visual Pathway
		- Visual receptors send their impulses away from the brain toward the center of the eye, where they contact neurons called bipolar cells
		- Bipolar cells contact still other neurons called ganglion cells
		- Axons from the ganglion cells join to form the optic nerve which turns around and exits the eye
		- Blind spot - retinal area where the optic nerve exits - no room for receptors
- Color Vision
	- 3 kinds of cones
		- Short-wavelength (typically blue)
		- Medium Wavelength (typically green)
		- long wavelength (typically red)
	- Cells in the visual path code this wavelength in terms of pairs of opposites - red vs green, yellow vs blue, and white vs black
	- Cells in the cerebral cortex compare the input from various parts of the visual field to synthesize a color experience
	- The Trichromatic Theory
		- Young-Helmholtz Theory
		- Color vision depends on the relative responses of three types of cones
	- The Opponent-Process Theory
		- We perceive color in terms of paired opposites
