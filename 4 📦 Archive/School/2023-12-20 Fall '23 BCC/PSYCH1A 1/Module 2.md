## Notes From Reading
### Module 3.1 NeuronsOur Bodies are like a machine - converting one type of energy into another
- Neurons - Brain cells
	- Glia - cells that support neurons, insulating, synchronizing activity and removing waste products
	- Neurons consists of 3 parts
		- cell body - contains the **nucleus** of the cell
		- dendrites - receiving information rom axons
		- axon - transmit information
			- some vertebrate axons are covered in Myelin - an insulating sheath that speeds up the transmission of impulses along an axon
- Action Potenial
	- Axons convert info over long distances by a process called Action potential
		- an excitation that travels along an axon at a constant strength, no matter how far it travels
		- it is the brain that has the touch sensation, not the part touched.
		- On or Off, Yes or no (like a light switch)
		- Pros: Brain receives signal at full strength
		- Cons: It takes time (at least a 20th of a second behind)
		- Process:
			1. Resting Potential:
				- electrical polarization across the membrane of an axon
				- sodium-potassium pump that pushes sodium ions out and pulling potassium ions in
			1. The action potential starts in either of two ways:
				- many axons produce spontaneous activity
				- input from other neurons can excite a neuron’s membrane
				- in either case, if excitation reaches the threshold of the axon, it briefly opens the gates in the axon through which sodium and potassium ions can flow.
			1. Sodium Ions rush in attracted by the negative charge inside.
				- the positive charge starts to stimulate the each point along the axon, opening sodium channels and repeating the process.
				- Sodium gates snap shut quickly while potassium gates stay open.due to the concentration inside the axon, potassium flows out of the axon.
				- their exit drives the axon back to resting potential.
			1. Eventually the sodium-potassium pump removes the extra sodium ions and recaptures the escaped potassium Ions
				- basically, Sodium enters the cell (excitation) then potassium leaves (return of resting potential)
- Synapses
	- the specialized junction between one neuron and another
	- a neuron releases a chemical that either excites or inhibits the next neuron 
	- Terminal Bouton - presynaptic ending - ending of an axon branch
	- when action potential reaches the terminal bouton - a neurotransmitter is released
		- a chemical that activates receptors on other neurons
	- postsynaptic neuron - receiving end of the synapse
	- some synaptic message are sudden onset (vision) while others are slower, longer-lasting (taste and smell)
	- inhibitory messages may stop receptors from accepting transmissions


### Module 3.3 Brain and Behavior
- First, we use all of our brain
- Monism - mental activity and brain activity are inseparable
- central nervous system
	- the brain and the spinal cord
- peripheral nervous sytem
	- nerves connecting the spinal cord with the rest of the body
	- somatic nervous system - connects to the skin andmucles
	- automatic nervous system - connects to the heart, stomach, and other organs
- sensory nerves bring info from other body parts to spinal board
- motor never take information from spinal cord to the muscles
- The Cerebral Cortex
	- hindbrain
	- midbrain
	- forebrain
		- two hemispheres
			- left and right control sensations and movement of opposite sides of the body
			- no one know why, same is true for all vertebrate and some invertebrate
	- Four lobes of the cerebral cortex
		- Occipital - at the rear of the head
			- specialized for Vision
		- Parietal - body sensations including touch pain temperature and awareness
			- primary somatosensorycortex
		- Temporal - hearing and certain aspects of vision - motion blindness
			- Amygdala - structure of the temporal lobe, responds directly to emotional situations
		- Frontal - primary motor cortex important for controlling fine movements
			- prefrontal cortex - important for memory of what just happened and what you are palling to do next
			- directing attention
			- decision making
				- impulsive decision making
			- Mirror neurons - active when you make a movement and also when you watch someone make a similar movement
				- some at birth but also developed over time by learning
	- Two hemispheres and their connections
		- most right handers and 60% of left handers control speech with left hemisphere, other left handers use both hemispheres
			- Corpus callosum - a set of axons that connect the left and right hemispheres of the cerebral cortex
- Measuring Brain Activity
	- EEG -  uses electrodes on the scalp to record rapid changes on brain electrical activity
	- MEG - records magnetic changes
	- PET - records radioactivity of various brain areas emitted from injected chemicals
	- fMRI - uses magnetic detectors outside the head to compare the amounts of hemoglobin with and without oxygen in different brain areas
- Subcortical Areas
	- thalamus - last stop for almost all sensory information on thee way to the verbal cortex
	- limbic system surrounds the thalamus
	- hippocampus - important for memory
	- hypothalamus - important for hunger, thirst, temperature regulation, sex and other motivated behaviors
	- cerebral cortex does not the muscles - sends output to pons and medulla (controls muscles of the head) and the spinal cord (controls muscles from the neck down)
	- reflex - rapid automatic response to a stimulus
	- cerebellum - important for aiming and timing
	- Automatic Nervous System
		- Controls Heart, digestive system and other organs
		- two parts:
			- Sympathetic Nervous System
				- increases heart rate, breathing rate sweating and other processes for vigorous fight or flight activities
			- Parasympathetic Nervous System
				- decreases heart and breathing rate, sweating
		- Influences the endocrine system
			- glands that produce hormones and release them into the blood stream.
- Experience and Brain Plasticity
	- Brain structure shows considerable plasticity - change as a result of experience
- Social Neuroscience
	- study of biological bases of social behavior
	- oxytocin, the love chemical
- The Binding Problem
	- The question of how separate brain areas combine forces to produce a unified perception of a single object
