1. Please provide two different 4-6 sentence descriptions of pieces of information from the traits section that you saw/heard that you found interesting. In these descriptions, cover what the topic discussed and detail why you found these facts interesting. Note: you should NOT directly quote anything (use your own words). --4 points


- Confused as a trait
	-  I am interested in the similarities and differences of traits that can or cannot be states. One that come to mind is confused. A trait is consistent behavior and a state is temporary behavior. I find this interesting because I think we can study the overlap alot more to understand how to better cope with harder states.

- ..., people with high belief in a just world are less likely to support preferential hiring for Blacks and women.
	- During the Search for Broad traits and the studies that came along with it. Researchers started similarities in behavior when it came to certain traits like belief in a just world. This was interesting to me because it is something that we see in the news and corporate America. This relates to the differences between Equality (giving everyone an equal starting point) and equity (given everyone what they need for a fair chance based on their reality.) When people believe in a just world, they believe that people get what they deserve and we shouldn't try to make up for inequality because the world is already fair and just. I find this interesting because we still need do more studies to understand why people feel like this and see what we can do to help them see that the world is not always fair and just.

- Societal factors that can be linked to certain disorders
	- As time passes, it's impossible to ignore that environment plays a huge role in mental illness and disorders. This was mentioned in the lecture as something that was recognized after the work of Philippe Pinel in the early 1800s. This was due to factors such as this illnesses being individualistic in nature and not passing from person to person like other illnesses as well as stress causing mental illnesses. A great example of this is the gun violence in America and how predominant it is here compared to the rest of the world. In schools alone, mental health is an epidemic that causes hundreds of gun deaths per year and is growing exponentially.

- Of course, cutting open the head to let out the demons. 
	- I did not know about the Trepanations of prehistoric mental illness remedies. The Shama treated mental abnormalities as spiritual or magical so they cut open peoples heads to let out the demon. Of course I find this sickening but what is interesting to me is how far humans have come in terms of empathy and compassion with other humans. It is obvious to be when reading about the history of clinical psychology and history in general is that humans had to develop the tools to evolve out of our animalistic instincts and have empathy for others. i also find it interesting how easy it is for humans to regress into these patterns like they did in the dark ages.



4. Provide a personal/specific example of how past theories of what causes mental disorders/abnormalities still persist in today's society.  To do this, not only describe the example in detail, but which past theory/theories relate to this example. --3 points

- What comes up for me is that sections of America and other countries still outlaw homosexuality and try to diagnose it as a mental ill. These cultures go so far to put children in conversion therapy to try to heal them of their homosexuality. I have friends who have told be stores about needing to leave their home and families because of were told they had demons inside of them causing them to go against Gods will of having a heterosexual relationship. This relates back to the prehistoric stages of Mental illness diagnoses and the use of trepanation to rid the mentally sick of their demons.

6. Go online and find an online test that allows you to find your "big 5 traits".  List the site's link, your scores on the big 5, and discuss if you agree with each of the assessments. --4 points

- The Big Five Scores from https://bigfive-test.com/result/65696c6d7e8d0c000805e3f9
	- Neuroticism: 77
	- Extraversion: 61
	- Openness to Experience: 80
	- Agreeableness: 86
	- Conscientiousness: 72
- For the most part, I agree with this rating. For extraversion, my friendliness score was 8 out of 20 which I would think to be low because I do feel I am friendly with everyone I come in contact with. I wouldn't say it should be above 12 though because I don't go out of my way to introduce myself to people even If I am at a party. I am surprised that my Openness to experience is high because for the most part, I shy away from trying new things like different foods that I have't had before. I do love traveling to new countries (which I know is kinda a contradiction because everywhere has different foods.)
