## From Textbook:
### Module 15.1 An Overview of Abnormal Behavior
- medical student's disease
	- people studying diseases often think they have it
#### Defining Abnormal Behavior
- Mental Disorder from APA (2013)
	- clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning
##### The Biopsychosocial Model
- Biological, psychological and sociological aspects of abnormal behavior
	- Biological
		- genetic factors
		- infectious diseases
		- poor nutrition
		- inadequate sleep
		- drugs
		- other influences on brain functioning
	- Psychological
		- reactions to stressful experiences
	- social and cultural context
		- behavior that is considered acceptable in one society may be labeled abnormal in another
##### Cultural Influences on Abnormality
- Different Cultures have different normalness
#### DSM and the Categorical ApproachTo Psychological Disorders
- Psychiatrists excpetd to diagnose and treat like doctors
- they created a reference book called Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
	- sets specific criteria for each psychological dianosis
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203160817.png]]
- helped to standardize diagnoses and speak the same language
- very hard to vategorize because people can fit into one category one study and a different one in another study
- instead of labeled, some psychologists use ratings based on several dimensions like this:
	- ![[Pasted image 20231203161146.png]]
- authors of the DSM moved partway toward this model but on for personality disorder
- personality disorder
	- *a maladaptive, inflexible way of dealing with the environment and other people*

	- A Critical Tool In the Field
		- Early Attempts:
			- Individualized List of Presenting Problems
			- Individual Definitions that each therapist developed to aid his/her own clients
			- all definitions and treatment plans were part of the school of thought that a clinician was operating under
		- New Approach:
			- DSM
			- generate uniform definitions and standards for clinical terms and diagnoses
		- Note: International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for WHO
	- Push back with DSM
		- differentiating normal from abnormal is difficult -most people often fall on a continuum of symptoms and disorders, not into a category
		- the imperfect sets issue
		- situational factors (breakup, death, job stability, etc) can create challenges when diagnosing disorders
		- disorder classifications are arbitrary and some seem to be more about reactions to issues than clinically related
			- homosexuality
			- autism spectral disorder debate
		- almost anyone seeking help is diagnosed with a mental disorder because of the size of the DSM
			- 50% diagnosis estimate
	- Advantages of the DSM
		- used by most every reputable clinic and clinician
		- time saving, extremely effective way of diagnosing and treating mental disorders
		- continually adapting and changing in order to be more accurate, effective, reflective of our society and the mental disorders that are described within it
		- there is no sign that we will discontinue the use of this manual in the near future 


### Mental Health Approaches Recording
- Mental Health Approaches
- Transitioning to  Today's Views
	- went through the history
-  **Psychosurgery**
	- based on the idea that abnormal is caused by physical abnormalities of the brain or nervous system
	- historical uses
		- electro-convulsive shock therapy
		- lobotomies
	- Today these approaches are rare and almost always focus on identifiable causes
- **Medications**
	- assumes that there are cellular/neurochemical link to certain disorders and mental issues
	- benefits: Quick results and powerful reduction of symptoms, wide range of symptom applications
	- costs: overmedication, addiction, tolerance effects, long term value concerns, concern over what's being "fixed"
- **Trending Ideas of Biology in Health
	- a new version of the biological approach looks to find the genetic components that make the developmental of a disorder more likely in an individual
		- the genetic counseling debate
- **Psychotherapy**:
	- a treatment of psychological disorders and mental issues through methods that include an interactive relationship between a trained therapist and a client or clients
		- belief: The source of mental health issues is thought based
		- main goal: addressing the mental sources of mental health issues
		- note: there are many forms of psychotherapy that exist
	- **Psychoanalysis**
		- Developed and introduced by Sigmund Freud
			- Based on his psychodynamic theory
			- identify unconscious thoughts, memories, and emotions that are disturbing, bring them to our conscious mind and address them
			- explores both present and past
			- uses different techniques (talk, hypnosis, dream interpretation)
			- very long, interactive, expensive
	- Behavioral Approach
		- Focus is on adjusting actions in order to eventually change the mind
		- begins with clear, well-defined goals
		- attempts to achieve those goals through different learning topics and the strengthening of behavioral connections
			- classical and operant conditioning use
			- systematic desensitization
	- CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)
	- The Humanistic Approach
		- Carl Rogers
		- Assumes mental health issues are a product of disliking, misperceiving or generating an incongruence of selves
		- assumes that clients are the only ones that can detect what is required to reach their full potential and address the reasons for why they sought therapy.
		- the therapeutic approach in this philosophy is called person or client-centered therapy
