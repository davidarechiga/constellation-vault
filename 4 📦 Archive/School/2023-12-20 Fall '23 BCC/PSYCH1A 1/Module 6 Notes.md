## From the Book

# 5.1 Cognitive Development in Infancy and Childhood
- Studying abilities of young children is challenging
## Research Designs for Studying Development
- **Cross Sectional and Longitudinal Designs**
	- Cross sectional study
		- compares groups of individuals of different ages at the same time
		- acceptable for many purposes but not always
	- longitudinal study
		- follows a single group of individuals as they develop
		- selective att ration
			- the tendency for certain kinds of people to drop out of a study
	- sequential (or cross-sequential)
		- combines cross sectional and longitudinal designs
- **Cohort Effects**
	- People of different generations differ in many ways
	- Cohort
		- a group of people born at a particular time or a group of people who enter an organization at a particular time
## The Fetus and the Newborn
- everyone starts as a fertilized egg cell (or zygote)
- then becomes a fetus after 8 weeks
- after 6 weeks, the nervous system is mature enough to produce spontaneous movements
	- essential because here the spinal cord starts to develop
	- fetus is very susceptible to alcohol
		- baby can develop fetal alcohol syndrome
			- a condition marked by malformations of the fast, heart and ears
			- nervous system damage including seizures, hyperactivity, impairments of learning, memory, problem solving attention, and motor coordination
## Infancy
- researchers monitors the few actions available to infants, drawing inferences about their growing understanding of the world
- **Infants Vision**
	- Starts with recording eye movements
	- ability to recognize faces continues developing for years
		- 4 year olds recognize faces of a book that’s being read to them for 2 weeks but find it hard to see differences in faces
		- 6 year olds can see the differences
- **Infants’ Hearing**
	- Infants suck more when they hear certain sounds
		- increased sucking rate on first few occasions
		- a repeated sound produced less effect
		- infant became ***Habituated*** to the sound
			- decreased response to a repeated stimulus
		- dishabituation
			- when a change in stimulus increases a previously habituated response
- **Infants’ Learning and Memory**
	- In studies, Infants sucked more frequently to turn on recording of their own mother’s voice than another woman’s voice
## Jean Piaget’s View of Cognitive Development
- somewhat older children are much easier to test
- this was discovered by Jean Piaget
- he concluded that children have qualitatively different thought processes from adults
	- they construct new mental processes
- Paiget’s term, behavior is based on schemata
	- a schema is an organized way of interacting with objects
	- assimilation
		- applying an old schema to new objects or problems
	- accommodation
		- modifying an old schema to git a new object or problem
- Piaget contended that children progress through 4 major stages of intellectual development
	- The sensorimotor stage (birth to almost 2 years)
	- the pre operational stage (just before 2 to 7 years
	- the concrete operations stage (from 7 to 11 years)
	- the formal operations stage (from about 11 years onward)

## Piaget’s Sensorimotor Stage
- mostly simple motor responses to sensory stimuli
- infants in the first few months lack object permanence
	- the idea that objects continue to exist even when we go not see or hear them
- Sense of Self
	- study shows that after years 1.5, an infant shows signs of sense of self but touching a red dot on their nose in the mirror
## Piaget’s Pre-operational Stage
- by this time children begin speaking
- if they ask for a toy, they obviously know object permanence but still misunderstand much
- they do not understand how their mother can be a daughter
- the child lacks operations which are reversible mental processes
- 3 typical aspects of pre operational thought:
	- egocentrism
		- a child sees the world as centered around himself or herself and cannot easily take another person’s perspective
		- **theory of mind**
			- an understanding that other people have a mind too and that each person knows some things that other people don’t know
	- difficulty distinguishing appearance from reality
		- in this stage, when a child sees you put a white ball behind a blue filter, the child will say the ball is blue even if you ask what color is the ball really.
	- lack of the concept of conservation
		- objects conserve such properties as number, length, volume, area, and mass after changes in the shape or arrangement of the objects

## Piaget’s Stages of Concrete Operations and Formal Operations
- at age 7, children begin to understand the conservation of physical properties gradually
- **stage of concrete operations**
	- children perform mental operations on concrete objects but still have trouble with abstract or hypothetical ideas
	- the “if you had a third eye where would you put it?” question.
- **Stage of Formal Operations (about age 11)**
	- logical deductive reasoning and systematic planning
- **Are Piaget’s Stages Distinct?**
	- Piaget believed this but later research doubts this
	- most psychologists today see developmental gradual and continuous
	- it is a matter of using their abilities in more and more situations
- **Differing Views: Piaget and Vygotsky**
	- Vygotsky argued we should not wait for children to rediscover the principles of physical and mathematics
	- ***zone of proximal development***
		- the distance between what a child can do alone and what is possible with help
		- this is like scaffolding when building a building

## How Grown Up Are We?
- Infant cognition -> Adult thinking
- egocentric thinking
	- do you know what i know?

# Module 5.2 Social and Emotional Development
- each age has their own worries
## Erikson’s Description of Human Development
- divide the human life span into eight periods called stages
- failure to master the task at any stage leaves unfortunate consequences that carry over to later stages
- infant trust vs mistrust
 **(error reading attachment)**
## Infancy and Childhood
- attachment
	- a feeling of cleanses toward another person
	- good attachments lead to more security down the road
	- measured with the strange situation
- temperament
	- tendency to reactive or inactive and to respond vigorously or quietly to new stimuli
## Social Development in Childhood and Adolescence 
- can be moody in adolescence
- things have changed since the early 1900s when you may have stopped school in early teens to have children or start working
- **Identity Development**
	- adolescence is about finding yourself
	- identity crisis
		- concern with decisions about the future and the quest for self-understanding
	- Identity diffusion
		- those who have not yet given any serious thought to making decisions and who have no clear sense of identity
	- Identity Moratorium
		- considering the issues but not yet making decisions
	- identity foreclosure
		- reaching firm decisions without much thought
	- identity achievement
		- the outcome of having explored various possible identities and then making one’s own decisions

- The “Personal Fable” of teenagers
	- what is true for everyone else is not for me
	- few people full outgrow the personal fable
## Adulthood
- What will I achieve
- extends from first full-time job to retirement
- already achieved success at work and accept the status
- midlife transition
	- a period of reassessing goals, setting new ones and preparing for the rest of life
## Old Age
- people age in different ways
- some deteriorate in intellect, coordination and ability to care for themselves
- others remain alert
- can be tough to lose control if you owned a business or were responsible for something
## The Psychology of Facing Death
- terror-management theory
	- we cope with our fear of death by avoiding thoughts about death and by affirming a worldview that provides self-esteem hope, and value in life

From the presentation:

### Jean Piaget
- leader in cognitive research
- assessing alfred binet
- focus was how children learn
- most people go through the same development
