## From Textbook:
### 15.2 Anxiety Disorders and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
#### Disorders with Excessive Anxiety
- Anxiety is similar to fear but fear is attached to a specific situation
- apprehensive feeling you cannot easily escape
##### Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
- frequent and exaggerated worries
##### Panic Disorder
- have frequent periods of anxiety and occasional attacks of panic - rapid breathing, increased heart rate, chest pains, sweating, faintness, and trembling
- common in adolescents and young adults
- linked to having strong autonomic responses such as rapid heartbeat and hyperventilation (rapid breathing)
- many people with panic disorder develop agoraphobia
	- an excessive fear of open or public spaces
- or social phobia
	- a severe avoidance of other people and a fear of doing anything in public
- may be embarrassed by having a panic attack
- treatment focuses on teaching the patient to control breathing and learning to relax
#### Phobia
- avoidance learning
	- leads to superstition
- phobia
	- a fear that interferes with normal living
##### Prevalence
- 11% of people suffer a phobia at some point in their life
- 5-6% have a phobia at any given time
- phobias vary from ild to extreme
##### Acquiring Phobias
- sometimes phobias can be traced back to a specific event and sometimes they can't
- genetic predisposition plays a role
- monkeys can learn to fear something from other monkeys
##### Some Phobias are More Common than Others
- we may be evolutionarily prepared to learn certain fears easily
- heights and unfamiliar men are part of this group
- the amount of bad experiences vs the number of safe experiences
##### Treatment for Phobias
- exposure therapy (systematic desensitization)
	- a method of gradually exposing people to the object of their fear
	- can use virtual reality
	- exposure therapy is highly effective temporarily and sometimes returns
#### Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
- obsession
	- repetitive unwelcome stream of thought
- Compulsion
	- repetitive almost irresistible action
- Obsessions Lead to compulsions
- 2-3% of all people in the United States suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder
- most at a mild degree
- moderate degree of genetic influence but no single gene has been identified
- DSM-5 lists OCD separately
	- people report disgust more than anxiety
- Many compulsions exist
	- cleaning
	- checking
	- counting steps
	- counting objects
	- counting anything
	- hoarding is common
##### Distrusting Memory
- checking locked doors and stoves
	- studies found checking makes memories less distinct
##### Therapies
- exposure therapy is best treatment supported by evidence
- People with OCD don't like exposure therapy
- Many people respond well to a cognitive Intervention to help them reinterpret their thoughts and images
- in some cases, anti-depressants work

### 15.4 Mood Disorders, Schizophrenia, and Autism
#### Depression
- Major depression
	- more extreme condition lasting weeks at a time, during which the person experiences little interest, pleasure, or Motivation
	- sleeping abnormalities
	- 20% of people are depressed at one point in their life
	- more common for whites than blacks
	- depression is widespread
	- few people remain depressed permanently 
	- seasonal affective disorder
		- people repeatedly become depressed during a particular season of the year
		- this can depend on location
##### Environmental and genetic Influences on Depression
- depression is often causes by a stressful event
- role of genetics is far from clear
- failed to identify a gene
- certain genes, such as one gene that influences serotonin levels in the brain increase the risk of depression only in people who endured major stressful experiences
- genes or other factors that predispose to depression increase vulnerability to many disorders not just depression
- inflammation is common in many disorders
- many treatments that decrease inflammation also help relieve depression
##### Treatments for Major Depression
###### Antidepressant Medications
- Tricyclic drugs interfere with the axon's ability to reabsorb the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin after releasing them
- Selective Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) block reuptake of only serotonin
- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors
	- block the metabolic breakdown of dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin
- antidepressants alter synaptic activity within an hour whereas mood improvement begins two to three weeks later.
###### Depressed Cognition and Cognitive Therapy
- people with pessimistic explanatory style are likely to be depressed now or to become depressed in the future
- Cognitive Therapy focuses on changing people's thoughts and encouraging a more active lifestyle
- Negative Cognitive triad of depression
	- I am deprived or defeated
	- the world is full of obstacles
	- the future is devoid of hope
###### Effectiveness or Ineffectiveness of Treatments
- psychotherapy and antidepressants are equally effective but neither is highly reliable.
- antidepressants work for severe depression
- depression get better over time so it's difficult to tell whether it was the drugs or not
###### Choosing between Psycho Therapy and Antidepressant Drugs
- Psychotherapy and Antidepressants combined can help more people
- drugs are cheaper but produce unpleasant side effects like dry mouth, difficulty urinating or increased blood pressure
###### Electroconvulsive Shock Therapy
- ECT
	- a brief electrical shock is administered across the patient's head to induce a convulsion similar to epilepsy
	- used in the 40s-50s but was using as abuse
	- 70s: came back in modified form for severe depression
	- still used after informed consent
	- shock is less intense with muscle relaxers
	- produces faster results than drugs or psycho therapy but effects do not last as long
###### Other Treatments
- Exercise can help
- study shows increase in physical activity lowered probability of depression
- depression predicts decrease in physical activity
- Omega-3 (fish Oil) have proven to be effective
#### Bipolar Disorder
- previously known as manic depressive disorder
- someone alternates between mood extremes
- mania
	- opposite of depression
- effective treatments for bipolar disorder include lithium salts and anticonvulsant drugs
#### Schizophrenia
- "split mind" between to the intellectual and emotional parts of oneself
- *not dissociative identity disorder or multiple personality disorder*
- in order to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, someone must exhibi a prolonged deterioration of faily activies such as work, social relations, and self-care and some combination of the following:
	- hallucinations
	- delusions
	- disorganized speech and thought
	- movement disorder
	- loss of normal emotional responses and social behaviors
- Positive Symptoms (defined by the presence of some behavior)
	- halluciantions
	- delusions
	- thought disorder and movement disorder
- Negative Symptoms (defined by the absence of a behavior)
	- lack of emotional expression
	- lack of motivation
	- lock of social interactions
##### Hallucinations
- perceptions that do not correspond to anything in the real world
	- hearing voices
##### Delusions
- belief that someone heolds strongly despite evidence against it
	- delusion of persecution
		- a belief that enemies are persecuting you
	- delusion of grandeur
		- a belief that you are unusually important
	- delusion of reference
		- a tendency to take all sorts of messages personally
- tough to diagnose schizophrenia on just delusions
##### Disordered Speech and Thought
- illogical
- incoherent
- distracted
- tangential
- issues with attention and working memory
##### Prevalence
- 1 to 4 people per though develop schizophrenia
##### Causes
- primarily genetics and prenatal environment, aggrevated by stress later in life
###### Genetics
- studies of twins and adopted children
	- high heritibility
	- brothers and sisters increased high probability
- copy number vaiants (errors)
	- deletions and duplications of tiny parts of a chromozone
	- found in 15% of people schizophrenia
###### The Neurodevelopmental Hypothesis
- schizophrenia originates with nervous system impairments that develop before birth or in early childhood, because of either genetics or early environment, especially prenatal environment
- common in these cases:
	- the mother had a difficult pregnancy, labor, or delivery
	- The mother was poorly nourished during pregnancy
	- the mother had influenza, rubella, other infection during early to mid-pregnancy
	- the mother had an extremely stressful experience early in her pregnancy
	- a mother with Rh-negatice blood type has given birth to more than one baby with Rh-positive bllod
	- the patient was exposed to lead or other toxins in early childhood
	- the patient was infected during childhood with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which attacks parts of the brain. The usual route of infection with this parasite is handling cat feces
- season-of-birth effect
	- a person born in the winter or early spring is slightly more likely to develop schizophrenia than a person born at other times
	- no other psychological disorder has this characteristic
	- possible influenza or infection during birth in the fall months
##### Brain Abnormalities
- on average, decreased gray matter in several brain areas and slightly enlarged cerebral ventricles
- smaller than average neurons
- many abuse alcohol or other drugs that might impair brain functioning
##### Therapies
-treatments are far from ideal but compared to past, much better
###### Medications
- antipsychotic drug
	- a drug that can relieve schizophrenia
	- produces variable degrees of recovery, effective after a month and comes back when stopped
	- block dopamine synapses
	- dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia
		- the underlying cause of schizophrenia is excessive release of dopamine in certain brain areas
		- several lines of evidence suggest that people with schizophrenia have deficient glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex
###### Side Effects and Alternative Treatments
- tardive dyskinesia
	- a condition characterized by tremors and involuntary movements
- atypical antipsychotic drugs
	- relieve schizophrenia with less risk of tardive dyskinesia
	- relieve the worst symptoms that other drugs don't but still have side effects
	- not sure they help the overall quality of life
- those who refuse antipsychotic drugs report responding well to cognitive therapy
#### Autistic Spectrum Disorder
- far more common in boys than girls
- main symptoms are:
	- impaired social relationships (little eye contact; little social contact)
	- impaired communication (repetitive speech; no sustained conversations)
	- stereotyped behaviors (repetitive movements such as flapping fingers)

## From Lectures:
### Anxiety and Mood Disorders
#### Anxiety Disorders
levels of anxiety disorders impact life
are persistent
are often undesired by those suffering
several types
	GAD
	panic disorder
	phobias
- GAD
	- involves pervasive free-floating anxiety
	- affected people also often feel
	- more diagnosed in women, people with lower income and relationship issues
	- Treatment
		- antidepressant medication has been commonly used for severe cases
		- several CBT approaches have shown to be effective treatments
- Panic Disorder
	- Symptoms
		- panic attacks: minutes long episodes of intense fear without a source
		- must occur several times for at least 1 month
	- Prevelance
		- 3% of the population is diangosed with this disorder at any give time
		- highly heritable disorder, before age 25
		- more commonly diagnosed in women than men (2.5x)
	- Treatment
		- antidepressants and behavior therapy are common treatments
		- aging and time are linekd to decrease in panic attacks
		- 
- Phobias
	- Fears are diagnosed as phobias when the anxiety to irrational fear of a particular or situation are extreme enough to interfere with everyday living
		- note: we all have things we're scared of, phobias go beyond that
	- Prevalence
		- 7-9% diagnosed at any given with at least 1 specific phobia
		- rates of phobias across topics vary dramatically
	- Treatment
		- behavioral therapy has been used for several phobias
		- CBT approaches have also shown to be effective
	- more sources
		- biological predisposition for certain fears
		- diathesis-stress model revisited
		- susan mineka's work on observational learning
		- albert bandura's work on desensitization through observation.
#### Mood Disorders
- all involve long term problems with basic emotions thathas a noticable and negative impact on life
- **depression**
	- most commonly diagnosed mood disorder
	- symptoms
		- negative mood and lethargic behavior
		- often involves cognitions and emotions of powerlessness, guilt and worthiness
		- can be linked to suicide but not always
		- often linked to sleep abnormalities
		- can also result in other mood issues and is comorbid
	- prevalence
		- 7+% of population in US are diagnosed at any given time with depression
		- rates vary dramatically from country to country
		- women are diagnosed with depression twice as much as men times 2
	- causes
		- family linked
		- linked to atypical neurotransmitter levels
		- life events contribute to the emergence of depression
	- Treatment
		- Regular sleep, diet changes and exercise
		- drug intervention
		- psychotherapies
		- note 1: people eventually show remissions of depression symptoms
		- note 2: once someone has gone through an episode, they have a higher likelihood of suffering from depressive episodes in the future
- There are a number of mood disorders that exist
	- depression
	- seasonal affective disorder
		- milder depressive symptoms
		- associated with the change of seasons
		- prevalence of disorder depends upon location
		- approx. 1% of Floridians
		- approx. 9-10% of minnesotans
		- light therapy is a popular treatment for this disorder, and very effective
	- persistent depressive disorder
		- Symptoms are similar to those of depression but are less severe and they lasts much longer than depression (2 years before diagnosis for adults, 1 year for children and adolescents)
		- diagnosed in about 2.5% of the population
		- not considered traumatic at any given time but can be very debilitating through it's long-term effects
			- comparing the two discussion
	- bipolar disorder
		- Moods alternate between depressive, level mood and manic symptoms
		- many forms of bipolar disorder
			- type I (at least one manic episode)
			- type 2 (hypomania and milder depression symptoms)
			- cyclothymia (hypomania and milder depressive symptoms)
			- diagnosed in about 1% of the population
				- sibling studies suggest a genetic cause
		- drug treatments are common
			- several outcome-based studies have shown the utility of specific techniques to help as well - though drugs are still commonly used in conjunction
			- Treatment is often lifelong
- Schizophrenia
	- not multiple personalities, sociopaths,
	- symptoms
		- positive
			- thoughts are present or added to the persons repertoire that a typical person does not have
				- hallucinations
					- auditory hallucinations are much more common than visual ones
						- almost all of us occasionally hear or see things that aren't there
						- based on frequency and complexity
					- brain research on this indicates why these are so challenging
				- delusions
					- very rigid false or unfounded beliefs
						- persecution
						- grandiose
						- reference
		- negative
			- behaviors that are diminished or absent
				- diminished ability to experience emotions
				- blunted affect (lacking expression of emotion)
				- social withdrawal
				- poor self-care
		- cognitive
			- abnormal functioning on cognitive tasks
		- affective
			- very strong mood-based reactions to the environment
			- severe depression
			- anxiety issues
		- Diagnosis
			- comes in a number of forms
				- types discussed in the book
			- The DSM requires that the person exhibit a deterioration of daily activities along with two of the symptoms discussed
				- not if the hallucinations or delusions are severe enough, no other symptoms are required in the diagnosis
			- 1-2% percent of populations
			- almost identical incidence in mena nd women (7:5 ration has been found in recent studies)
			- onset is usually sometime between 16 and 25 years old
		- theorized causes
			- genetic
			- brain abnormality
			- neurodevelopment hypothesis during gestation
			- the diathesis-stress model used today
