# Module 6 Write Up

For this module's activity, we are going to run a "case study".  In this case study, you are asked to write a report of a hypothetical multifaceted test you ran that addresses all of the components described below. Demonstrating comprehension, clarity, and depth in your descriptions of this case study is critical to earn full credit for this activity. Please note that these "case studies" can be formatted and written in many ways.  Creativity in your writing is strongly encouraged, as is exploring the different ways case studies can be written.  I really want you to get out of your comfort zone in this and try something new, so please research these a bit before writing this post.

**Requirements**

The first step of this case study is to come up with and describe a fictional child between the ages of 0 and 12. --2 points

Then, you'll need to indicate what stage of cognitive development the child should be going through based on their age, as well as the challenges they're likely encountering because they're in that stage. --2 points

After that, you'll need to "test" this child's level of cognitive development by running them through 4 cognitive tests that relates to things we covered in this module.   When describing these tests, be sure to describe what you're doing in each test, why you're conducting it, the performance of the child, and what these results imply. --8 points

Lastly, you will need to propose a few ways that you might be able to help the child master some of his/her cognitive challenges by building off of the theories of Lev Vygotsky --3 points

Please be sure to write the case study out as if you were a scientific observer of the child. As mentioned earlier please play around with this a bit, but make sure that you provide a lot of specific details, your descriptions of the tasks and concepts are clear, and that you display good comprehension of the material.  There is no page requirement on this, but most good papers are at least 2 double spaced pages.

# Quincy: A Case Study of the Preoperational Stage of Child Development

### Overview
Quincy is a 4 year old boy living with his mother Annie and father Ryland in Vancouver, Canada. Quincy has an older brother, Kenzo, who is 9 years old. 

### Development History
Quincy was born about two months prematurely, weighing only about 2 pounds. Over the course of 5 months, Quincy grew to a healthy weight and was responding to different types of stimuli. By the age of 2, Quincy started speaking his first words, mama and data, as well as showing obvious signs of object permanence by asking for items that are not visible like food and toys. These are all signs of the typical child development around this age. 

### Current Cognitive Development Stage
Quincy is now going through the preoperational stage of cognitive development. Because of this, Quincy will face a number of different challenges such as being unable to understand the concept of conservation, lacking operations, and the inability to distinguish the appearance of an object from it’s true appearance.

### Testing Cognitive Development
For this case study, we have detailed 4 tests in order to track Quincy’s progress through the preoperational stage of early childhood development.

**Test 1: The Three Mountains Task**
**Method**
A model with 3 mountains, all which contain different attributes, is placed in front of the child. The model has 4 sides from which you can view, the front (A), the left (B), the back (C), and the right (D). After getting a 360 degree view at the model, Quincy sits in the A position looking at the front. The investigator then asks Quincy “if your friend sat at a different side than where you are sitting, what would they see?” and shows Quincy 4 photos, one taken from each side of the model. 
**Results**
Quincy gives the incorrect answer and points at the first photo, the same perspective that Quincy is sitting.
**Interpretation**
This shows us that Quincy has yet to overcome this egocentric thinking and still does not understand that everyone has their own mind with a different perspective than his.

**Test 2: Theory of Mind Test**
**Method**
Quincy and his older brother Kenzo watch a mother and daughter in the kitchen looking at a cupcake. The daughter then sees the mother put a cupcake in the right cupboard which is blue and plans to return at a later date to eat it. When the daughter is not looking, the mother moves the cupcake to the left side of the cupboard which is green. The investigator then separately asks Quincy and Kenzo which cupboard will the daughter try to retrieve the cupcake from?
**Results**
Kenzo answer correctly: the daughter will try to retrieve the cupcake from the original cupboard but Quincy answers incorrectly: that the daughter will look in the green cupboard for the cupcake.
**Interpretation**
Older children understand that different people will know different things. Kenzo understood that even though he saw the mother move the cupcake, the daughter wouldn’t have known that because she was absent. Quincy does not understand this and assumes the daughter will know to look in the green cupboard because he knows the cupcake is in the green cupboard.

**Test 3: The Conservation of Volume Test**
**Method**
Two identical glasses filled with the same amount of water are set out in front of Quincy. The investigator asked if both glasses have the same amount of water in them. After Quincy gives his answer. While Quincy is watching, the investigator then pours the water from one glass into a glass that is taller and more thin. The investigator then asks if the tall glass and the short glass have the same amount of water and Quincy gives his answer.
**Results**
Quincy gives the correct answer to the first question but then, even though he watched the investigator pour the water into a new glass, he answers the second question incorrectly.
**Interpretation**
This shows us that Quincy fails to recognize the conservation of volume.

**Test 4: Distinguishing Appearance from Reality Test**
**Method**
The investigator shows a white ball to Quincy and asks him about the color of the ball. After Quincy answers, he places the ball behind a blue filter and asks Quincy what color the ball is. Quincy Answers. After questioning Quincy about the balls actual color, he gives the same answer.
**Results**
Quincy gives the correct color of the ball when looking at it directly but answers incorrectly both times when the ball is behind the blue filter.
**Interpretation**
Quincy struggles to know what color the ball is in reality when its appearance is blue because of the filter.

Vygotsky believed that children might be able to learn faster than the timeframes that Piaget had stated in his research with little help along the way. He compared this help to scaffolding when building a building.

One way to help Quincy start to overcome egocentric thinking is to have less options when presenting the three mountains task. Instead of having 3 other options of perspectives, maybe only have 1 or 2 and leave out the perspective at which Quincy is sitting. This can help Quincy narrow down his options and answer correctly.

Another way to use Vygotsky’s theory during the Conservation of Volume test is to use glasses that are similar but not identical, maybe they have the width but not the same height.

During the Distinguishing Appearance from Reality Test, maybe having multiple color filters to show that the ball changes colors can help Quincy realize the ball isn’t changing only it’s appearence
