# Module 5 Memory Notes



From the book:
# 7.1 Types of Memory
memory is the retention of information
## Ebbinghaus’s Pioneering Studies of Memory
- ebbinghaus taught people then studied their memory after various delays
- he memorized thousands of lists of nonsense syllables
- he measured the time it takes for memorize long lists
## Methods of Testing Memory
### Free Recall - explicit memory
- to produce a response as you do on essay tests or short answer tests
### Cued Recall
- receive significant hints about the material
### Recognition
- someone chooses the correct item among several options
### Savings
detects weak memories by comparing the speed of original learnings to the speed of relearning
### Implicit Memory
- an experience influxes what you say or do even though you might not be away of the influence
### Procedural Memories and Probabilistic Learning
- Procedural Memories - memories of how to do something
- declarative memories - memories we can readily state in words
- think typing on a keyboard
	- can you state where the keys are? Why can you type so fast?
- Differences
	- depend on different parts of the brain
	- brain damage and affect one and not the other
	- procedural memory develops gradually
	- you often form a declarative memory all at once

 **(error reading attachment)**
## Application: Suspect Lineups as Recognition Memory
- you may have a hard time picking a suspect out of a handful of people. there is pressure to be sure.
- ways to improve this
	- instruct the witness that the guilty personal may or may not be there
	- the officer should be a blind observer (doesn’t know who it is)
	- if the witness says there is a scar (all the suspects should have a scar)
	- delay any feedback
	- ask the witness to specify for each person in the lineup
## Children as Eyewitnesses
- ask to recall an event in which the facts are known
- adults overestimate how well a child understands something
- Influences of accuracy in sound child reports
	- delay of questioning
	- repeating the question
	- type of question
		- open ended
			- short but accurate
		- suggestive (yes/no)
			- less accurate
	- hearing other children
	- using physical representations
	- understanding the question

## The Information-Processing View of Memory
- information that enters the system is processed, coded, and stored
- Short Term Memory
	- temporary storage of recent events
- Long Term Memory
	- a relatively permanent store
	- semantic memory - memory of principles and facts
	- episodic memory - memory for specific events in your life
		- more fragile
- Source Amnesia - forgetting when, where, or how you learned something
- Capacity of Short Term Memory and Long-Term Memory
	- Long-Term has a vast and hard to measure capacity
	- Short term has a limited capacity
		- about 7 letters or numbers
		- you can store more by chunking - grouping items into meaningful sequences or clusters
	- Decay of memories over time
		- short term only last for a short time unless rehearsed
		- long term ay be indefinite such as old people and events

## Working Memory
- Consolidation
	- converting a short term memory into a long term memory
	- not all short term memories become long term memories
	- Working Memory
		- a system for working with current information
		- information you use and forget
		- executive function - governs shifts of attention

# 7.2 Encoding, Storage Retrieval
## Encoding
- repetition does not guarantee strong memory
- Factors that influence encoding
	- attention
	- Emotional arousel
	- primary effect
	- recency effect
	- unusual
- Depth of processing principle
	- how easily you retrieve a memory depends on the number and types of associations you form 
- Encoding Specificity
	- when you encode, you form associations
	- retrieval cutes - reminders
	- Encoding Specificity Principle
		- the associations you form at the time of learning will be the most effective retrieval cues later

## How to Organize Your Studying
- Studying All at once or spread out
	- studying all at once is the worst way to studying
	- need to practice retrieving the memory to strengthen the memory

- Advantages of Varied Study
	- It’s better to vary your studying with different sections
	- vary the conditions
- Taking notes during class
	- record main ideas
	- better to write notes than type them
- What you learn during testing
	- essential to practice recalling
## Mnemonic Devices
- any memory aid based on encoding items in a spiral way
- method of loci
	- first you memorize a series of places, and then you use a vivid image to associate each location with something you want to remember
## Storage
- Consolidation

## Retrieval
- hypermnesia
	- gain of memory over time
- Focusing on one part of the memory weakens the rest of it temporarily
- reconstruction
	- during an experience you construct a memory. when you try to retrieve that memory, you reconstruct an account based partly on distinct memories and partly on your expectations of what must have happened
- hindsight bias
	- the tendency to mold our recollection of the past to fit how events later turned out

# Notes from Presentation
Presentation 1
- Previous learnings from conditioning
- Memory debate
	- people worried about studying memory
	- individual differences
		- peoples own memory and bend in different ways
		- how do we determine the quality of memory
- ebbinghaus - studied memories on himself
	- even-though his findings were very specific to himself, he really showed us that studying memory was possibleModule 6 Write Up
- Exercise
	- bem - only got one
- EH’s work led to an all or nothing approach to studying memory
	- became free recall tests
- Cued recall tests
	- recalling states example
- recognition test
	- naming the dwarves activities
		- throw up a list of names and pick
- Savings test
	- elemental tables example
	- participants can quick relearn
- implicit memory tests
	- stimulus / réponse pairs (classical conditioning)
	- Learned motor task example (anterograde amnesia)
		- cannot make new long term memories 
		- the start drawing test
			- couldn’t explain
- 3 steps
	- encoding -  the process of converting information into a form that will allow us to retrieve that info later
	- storage = the process of retaining critical information for later use
	- retrieval - the process of accessing the stored information that we have encoded in order to use it in a situation.
- Temporal memory states
	- external events
	- sensory memory
		- considered a hypothetical state of memory for years
		- involves all our senses
		- most of this info is said to only last in our memory for a fraction of a second
		- infinite capacity
		- after fraction of a second, you attend to/remember only the information deemed relevant
		- encoding happens between sensory and short term
	- short term memory
		- about 7 items capacity +- 2 items
		- contains information that we deemed relevant at the time
			- both past and new information
		- information can be stored in this stage of memory from anywhere between 10 seconds to a few days
		- after that, memories stored are either:
			- forgotten
			- placed in our long-term memory store
	- long time memory
		- consists of information from STM that we identified as important and had the ability and time to store
		- information in this part of our memory can be very complex but it is also very susceptible to distortions and complete fabrications
		- do we ever forget info in our long term memory?
		- categories
			- declarative
				- episodic
				- semantic
			- non declarative (procedural)
				- skill learning
				- priming
				- conditioning
