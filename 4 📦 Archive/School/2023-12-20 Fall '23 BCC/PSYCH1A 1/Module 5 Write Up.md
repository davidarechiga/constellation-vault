# Module 5 Write Up

1. Please provide your own example in 6-10 sentences of how all 3 types of memory (sensory, short-term, long-term) play a role in a conversation.  Be sure the description defines each type of memory in your own words, and describes how they interact. --5 points

**An old acquaintance was walking in your neighborhood and saw you walking by. You didn’t see them but they used their long term memory (*****relatively permanent memories that have been encoded and can be retrieved at a much later date*****) and called your name from across the street (which gets stored in your sensory memory for just a few seconds).  You are able to take that sensory memory (*****information from your senses that gets stored for just a second*****) and recognize their voice from your long term memory. It’s a friend from grade school you haven’t seen in many years. You walk over and start a conversation about how you’ve been and they mention they are now in school working toward an electrical engineering degree and need to find a coffee shop to study at. They also say they just got married to their partner, Emily. You use your short term memory (*****temporary storage of recent events*****) to recall the coffee shop you were just at early this morning and give this as a recommendation because you remember it was quiet and had fast internet. You also remember you are going to a party later and want to invite them and their wife. You use your short term memory to remember their partner’s name Emily and invite them, they say yes.**


2. Please discuss in 4-6 sentences 1 topic from the first presentation that you found particularly interesting. --3 points

**Implicit Memory is interesting to me because it is focused on bodily responses versus what memories we can freely recall. Our brain can remember so many more aspects of our life without us really understanding consciously. It’s why playing the piano comes so natural to me even when I haven’t played in a while. Even though I may not be able to recall certain parts of music theory that I have learned in the past, when I sit down at a piano, my fingers just know where to go to make certain sounds come out to elicit different emotions. Makes me think of the book “The Body Keeps Score” which talks about the effects of psychological trauma.** 


3. Please discuss in 4-6 sentences 1 topic from the second presentation that you found particularly interesting. --3 points

**The concept of interference is very interesting to me because I feel I am having trouble learning new concepts because of this. Proactive Interference is when new information is lost or less accurate because it overlaps with previous knowledge that you have encoded. An example of this is when I got married, Camille went from being my fiancé to my Wife. Because of this interference, I still mistakenly call her my fiancé when speaking about her with others.**

4. Please describe at least 2 things that you will do to study for the upcoming exam that relate to some of the memory enhancement concepts that we discussed in this module's class. Please note that just making things up that don't relate to what we covered in this module will not earn you any points. Use what you just learned to come up with a good plan. --4 points

**Two actions I will take to help with my studies are spreading out my studying over multiple days and various environments as well as use my laptop less when taking notes.**

**Spreading out my studying will make sure that I come back to the information to refresh the ideas in my brain and strengthen my retrieval of the information. I will also go through the review of the last chapters material before starting the current chapter to make sure I am encoding that information into my long term memory to make it stronger.**

**I will also use a notebook to hand write notes during the presentation so I am less distracted by my laptop. I can then type the notes into my laptop later so I can further encode it into my long term memory.**
