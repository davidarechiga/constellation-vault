1) According to Austin and Willard's  "Introduction: Angels of History, Demons of Culture," what is culture and how is culture produced? 

- **Answer:** Culture is authoritative manipulation that drives the agendas of the older generations. In this context, Culture is the product of constant pushing and pulling of the generational pendulum in which the two extremes are control of self and control of youth. Austin and Willard state in the text, "Declines in state funding for education are matched by increased funding for prison construction and maintenance." I believe this to mean the people in power in the united states use our legal system to control the youth by defunding programs responsible for critical stages in a child's development. An under-educated youth is more likely to turn to crime as a means to survive and once they are labeled as criminals So, not only is the school to prison pipeline streamlined, it creates an identity for the youth to assume which becomes very hard to break once believed. The more we take away important funding for education, the more we have to focus on just getting by, leaving little room to tend to the individualistic needs of each child. These messages are often hypocritical of what the people in power say are their intentions for the youth. 

2) Using Austin and Willard's ideas of culture, give me your opinion as to how films play a role in forming/fabricating culture?

- **Answer:** Film plays a role in the forming of culture in the way of creating social standards of existence. Films create major social movements through time. One such example is the Marvel Cinematic Universe and how it changed the social perception of comic books and the fans of comic books. Now it is cool to like comics where 30-50 years ago, you were considered a nerd who couldn't get a girlfriend if you had comic books.
