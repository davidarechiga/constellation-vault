**Terminology/Identifications (IDs)**

Read  [Charles Ramírez Berg, _Latino Images in Film: Stereotypes, Subversion, and Resistance_.(University of Texas Press: 2002), pp. 13-37, 38-51.](https://peralta.instructure.com/courses/68136/files/8462662/download?wrap=1 "Theorizing in Film.pdf")

Pay attention specifically to the **IDs in pp. 38-51.** For each of the following ID's provide three concise sentences that flow together: 

1. Define the term (IDS)
2. Provide example not listed in the book, 
3. Provide how term relates to the study of Films; if possible, tell how it applies to an MLAT Film's Class

Note: Definition should demonstrate that you understand the general idea of the IDs.

Even if you do not understand some ID's, always give it your best shot. Lastly, not all IDs are in the Berg's reading. You have to look that up, and also give it your best shot. 

**Identifications**

Dominant-Narrative:  Dominant narratives are frequently repeated stories share by the dominant in-group in the form of stereotypes. An example of this in real life are dark/poor people are criminals. This relates to film because we often find many stereotypes in film which often change our beliefs and more immportantly, change our attitudes about a group of people how are not in our "in-group"

**Short Responses** 

1) Short response/reaction to both you tube videos on the History of Ethnic Studies. 

First Video:
Of the many important takeaways of the first video about the strike and arrests at California Hall at UC Berkeley, what resonated with me the most was how the students used the momentum of past strikes to fuel the motivation. As the people in power at Berkeley takeaway funding for ethnic study's so that classes can no longer be offered hand professors can no longer be hired, it becomes harder for students of latin decent to feel connected to their studies and feel like they belong. For some of the strikers, their family went on strike in the same fight just one generation before them. This is significant because The fight for representation is never over.

Second Video:
Throughout history before 1960, many if not all schools and universities were white male dominant. There was no ethnic studies at these schools and no way to connect with the chicano history. As a person who is half Mexican who has not connected to my heritage, sometimes I feel lost and and feel like I don't belong (another reason why I am thankful for this class at this stage in my studies).



2) Look at ID's and Why do we stereotype in film? **(p. 28)**

3) What is Chicano/Latino Film Theory and Criticism Phase I, Phase II, Phase III? **(See. Page 33-37**)

4) Also, now that you know a little about Culture (re: Assignment 1), how do you understand the term **Hegemony**? Can you give an example of why would this be important as it relates to film?

This **Assignment** is intended to equip you with tools for unpacking and deciphering what you will see in films. What are viewers/you being asked to take as history or Truth? Or what are the viewers of being asked to consider **by default** of the films's claims of to truth.

  
Another question to ask ourselves is: What is the director trying to convince me to do? What is involved in the films?

Knowing this will help you write/articulate your film-viewing response in the coming assignments better.

Best,
