# Notes on Stern Grove for Flaming Lips
The concert itself is free and open to the public, and starts at 2 pm
Stuff to Bring
1. **Blanket or Camping Chairs**: You won't find chairs or other seating, so I **recommend bringing along something to sit on**.
2. **Food & Drinks**: There is a small cafe on site that sells a limited amount of food and beverages. **You can also bring along your own** and have a nice picnic lunch in the park during the concert.
3. **Alcohol**: The cafe does not sell alcohol, but the park does **allow** you to **drink beer and wine** during the shows in the Concert Meadow and West Meadow.
4. **Warm Jackets & Clothing**: Since Stern Grove is closer to the Pacific Ocean, it does get **cooler** here. Make sure you **bring along a jacket o**r wear warm clothing in case the temperatures are cool **during the show. You want to be prepared for the wind, fog,** and even a little sunshine.

The **gates open at 12 pm.** They only allow people with advanced registration in, but you will still want to go early to grab a seat as seats are still first come/first served. **Not every one with a ticket will be allowed entry.**

No pets are allowed in this area of the park during the concerts.

**Neither pictures nor video is permitted** during the shows. Make sure you keep an eye on your personal items at all times. It gets crowded (and is free!), so can **attract people looking to pick up** a few unattended items.

While the main entrance at the corner of 19th Avenue and Sloat Boulevard is easy to find, there are **additional entrances along Wawona Street to the north**. These less crowded entrances may allow you to get in quicker and find a seat.

You'll want to be on your best early bird game since seating at Stern Grove is general admission. All entrances open at noon on concert days.

We encourage you to use **public transit or ride shares.** However, if getting there with your vehicle is the only way, make things easy on yourself by using SpotHeroOpens in new window to reserve parking ahead of time.
