Certainly! Here's an updated description that incorporates wedding rings and the date of your wedding:

"I would like to commission a unique enamel pin as a special gift for attendees at my upcoming wedding. The pin should artfully combine several elements that hold deep meaning for my partner and me. Firstly, we would love for the pin to incorporate an apple, symbolizing our love for New York City, where our journey began. The apple can be vibrant red and exquisitely designed. Additionally, we would like to include a microphone to represent our shared passion for karaoke, displayed in a stylish and artistic manner.

To further personalize the pin, we would like to incorporate wedding rings, symbolizing the lifelong commitment we are about to make. These rings can be elegantly portrayed, perhaps entwined with the apple and microphone. Lastly, please include the date of our wedding, 'September 30th, 2023,' as an integral part of the design.

We hope that through your creativity and attention to detail, this enamel pin can become a cherished keepsake for our wedding guests, encapsulating the essence of our love story. Thank you for your talent and dedication in bringing this vision to fruition!"
