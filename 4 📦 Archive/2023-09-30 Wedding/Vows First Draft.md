# Vows First Draft

Camille, I couldn’t explain it then but I knew in my soul it was you. After almost 7 years of being your partner, I will attempt to explain what exactly it was I saw in your eyes that night that told me you were the woman I would marry Maybe it was you coming back to my apartment that first night and correcting the way I played blink 182 on guitar after playing it wrong for 20 years. Maybe it was how you furiously defended my speech when someone asked if I remembered my name. 

From the moment I met you, I knew you were kind, courageous, and determined and you have proved this ever since. Over the last 7 years, I have found you to be organized, resourceful and detailed. 

I promise to keep you as updated as to date on new music as I am. I promise to do everything I can to calm your anxiety when things feel uncertain. I promise to remind you that the only thing that matters is the present moment. I promise to be there to hold you up when you feel like your world is collapsing.
