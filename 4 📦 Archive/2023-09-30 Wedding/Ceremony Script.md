# Ceremony Script

Good evening everyone!

From this place (here the minister or officiant should describe something about your chosen ceremony venue/location, about the significance or beauty of the location), we take ourselves out of the usual routines of daily living to witness a unique moment in the lives of Camille and David. Today they join their lives in the union of marriage.

To all their guests, they are happy to share this moment with you. They have known most of you for many years. You watched them grow up, you went to school with them, or you worked with them. Because you are the ones who have supported them and known them so well, it is only fitting that you are the ones to share this once-in-a-lifetime moment with them.
Camille and David are pleased to have their parents in the front row…close to them for the ceremony.

Camille thanks her parents for providing her with every opportunity possible and being the best parents anyone could ask for.

David appreciates all the love and support his parents gave him over the years.

A wedding day is often a day when couples miss family members no longer with them. For Camille and David, there are family members whose memories they hold dear.

(Here you can insert references to loved ones that have passed away.  Or you can mention loved ones that couldn’t be present for other reasons.)

And so it is that Camille and David present themselves to be married today…surrounded by the people they love the most.

Officiant:
As Camille and David prepared for the ceremony part of this wedding celebration, they reflected on what it is that they love about each other.  And this was was the easiest part of planning this wedding!
To the Groom:
______ (Groom’s name), ______ (Bride’s name) loves that you blend in so comfortably with her family. She sees in you a funny, kind, and sweet man. She loves that you think she is funny and that you always find a way to compliment her.
She loves that you always want to be close to her. You remember details of the stories she tells. You want to be part of her family and circle of friends. You help her around the house. Most importantly, you are so close that even when she is at her worst, you have never made her feel like you want anything but to be closer to her.

______ (Bride’s name), _____(Groom’s name) loves that you ______________________(fill in the blank). He loves your brain, your smile, and your beauty. He appreciates that you are “low maintenance.” He likes that you can be really silly. He loves your emails and texts. He loves your cooking. He loves your kisses. He just really loves you!

You both look to a shared future that includes raising a happy &  healthy family. That future also includes a richly lived life together…going out to restaurants, hanging out with family, relaxing at home in front of the TV, singing and dancing…Bride will do the singing, and Groom will do the dancing.

The years will come and go…you won’t take each other for granted, you will laugh a lot, you will be the best parents you can be, you will grow older and wiser together. It’s a good story,and the ending is not in sight!
