# Questions for Nova







What things are locked in and what things can change?  In what time frame do we have to change them? For example, add ons like the light wall, color of linens, etc.

If we don’t lock in the Nova DJ and pay the DJ fee, can we still use the nova DJ if that’s what we want?

Do we have to have a Doorman? Can we hire our own Doorman?

Is there an itemized list of all the responsibilities for the Door man?

Is there an itemized list of all the responsibilities of A/V and tech?

How close to the wedding do we have to change the drink packages if we want to have different packages throughout the night?

Are the payment dates set in stone or flexible?

Is there a reason that Bar-back are the same cost as the bartender? Why are they there for 6 hours when drinks are only served for 4 hours?
