i know you're having a hard time and i hate to see that. i have always had mad respect for you since the day we met and i will do everything i can to never let you down. i will only ever be honest with you and will respect your trust and privacy... 

no matter what we are doing, i'm having fun
examples:
1. straightening your hair
2. going to the grocery store
3. falling asleep on the train
4. going to 5ave for literally no reason
5. working out
6. cooking
7. being in the bathroom while you go to the bathroom
8. looking at your watch activity.
seriously i want nothing more than you and it's scary for me but i know it's definitely scary for you. maybe the feeling was just new at first and i was filling an empty space because of the long distance. i was definitely afraid of just being a space filler but as we've gotten to know each other, it's been so much more than empty spaces. it's the feeling of having an other half. it's the smiles we don't have to work for. smiles that just appear when our eyes catch. it's closing my eyes and seeing your face. thinking about all the times we opened up about who we are like we've known each other since grade school.
