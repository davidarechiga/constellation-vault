[75 Wedding Vow Examples That Will Melt Your Heart](https://www.southernliving.com/weddings/wedding-vow-examples)

**Here's a checklist to help you write your wedding vows:**

1. Reflect on your relationship: Take time to think about your journey as a couple, the moments you've shared, and the experiences that have shaped your love.

2. Define the tone: Decide on the overall tone you want for your vows. Do you want them to be sentimental, humorous, or a combination of both?

3. Start with an attention-grabber: Begin your vows with a heartfelt opening line or a personal story that captures the essence of your relationship.

4. Express your love and admiration: Share what you love and appreciate about your partner. Highlight their qualities, virtues, and how they make you feel.

5. Recall special moments: Recall cherished memories or significant milestones you've experienced together. Mention specific events that have strengthened your bond.

6. Share your promises: Make promises to your partner about how you will support, love, and care for them. Be sincere and specific about the commitments you are making.

7. Incorporate personal anecdotes: Use personal stories or anecdotes that illustrate your love and connection. These can add depth and authenticity to your vows.

8. Speak from the heart: Be genuine and sincere. Avoid clichés and use your own words to express your emotions. Remember, it's about your unique love story.

9. Keep it concise: Aim for a length that feels meaningful but not excessively long. Remember that you'll be speaking in front of others, so keep your vows within a reasonable time frame.

10. Seek feedback and practice: Share your vows with a trusted friend or family member for feedback. Practice reading them aloud to ensure they flow well and convey the desired emotions.

11. Make a written copy: Write down your final vows neatly and legibly. This will help you stay composed during the ceremony and serve as a keepsake for the future.

12. Embrace emotions: Don't be afraid to show your emotions during the delivery. It's a deeply personal and significant moment, and letting your emotions shine can make it even more touching.

Remember, these guidelines are flexible, and you should personalize your vows to reflect your unique relationship. Good luck with your wedding vows!

### From Reddit

A friend of mine is an officiant, and she shared with us a template that she had made. My husband and I both worked off the template but wrote our vows separately. When we read them to each other we were both amazed at how similar they were! My advice is don't write generically about love, write about your husband. Specific things that only apply to you and him. That makes your vows personal and meaningful. I hope this helps!

Here's the template:

When I first met you, I....

[An important significant memory about other]

My favorite part about you....

I like that you....[several examples]

I like that you...[more examples, but with more significant meaning.]

As your husband/wife, I promise you that I will continue to [several examples of what you already do that

you will continue to do (one or two can be silly)]

I promise you that I [several examples of what you promise during our future together]

I promise to [several examples. (more about love and deep significant things.)]

I promise to [a few more examples (on how you’ll specifically help me to reach my potential, or

whatever).]

I promise you that I will [how you’ll work on making our relationship work]

I promise you my heart, [person’s name]. That [this is the last paragraph! Be sweet and thoughtful and

awesome, cause this is what everyone is going to remember!]

[Sweet, charming reference back to significant memory that ties everything together.]

### Tips from Reddit 2:

So, I'm a writer. I have an English degree in creative writing, with a concentration in poetry, sooo... that is where my advice is stemming from.

Before you do anything else: research research research! Read other people vows, as many as you can find! What do you like about them? What do you not like? Having a well-formed idea of your own taste can really make a difference. Also, read some poetry. It'll help get your mind in the mood to think about images and words you may not commonly find paired together, and start constructing some interesting pairing's itself! Then, follow these steps (if they make sense for you. Not all writer's write alike!)

1.	⁠Follow a template. Find one you like, either one suggested here, or elsewhere (apracticalwedding.com etc). This is not a cop out. This is a resting place for your brain to deposit ideas into. Once you feel secure that the structure is solid, you can rest easy and devote all your time and energy towards being creative in your word-choice etc.
2.	⁠What does your structure call for? An anecdote? A list of reasons your fiancee is the coolest? The promises you intend to keep for all time? All of the above plus some other stuff? Try to turn each aspect of the template into a question you need to answer, and put it at the top of a piece of paper/document. One question per page/document. Give yourself room to fill in the answers.
3.	⁠Let the cheese-tastic out. Answer your questions and don't edit yourself; get the awful, the obvious, and the cheese out of your system. Write them down, laugh at them, move on.
4.	⁠Look at all that cheese! Delicious, gas-inducing cheese. Now is the time to get specific. Maybe everything you came up with is obvious, and now you are out of ideas. Not in this workshop! What kind of cheese is it? Nutty Swiss? Black-label sharp cheddar? Aged blue? Look at every word you've written, and find a better word(s) to take it's place. How can you be more specific? If you are writing an anecdote, write out every single second you can remember. Sure, you ate nachos and cheese at the fair, but who bought them? who spilled yellow-goo-food on their shirt first? Did you wipe it away with a cheap white napkin or full-sheet-sized paper towel? Make every single aspect as specific as possible. You want the most words ever. This is not the time to think about word counts.
5.	⁠Look at all those lovely you-and-your-hubby specific words and sentences you've flushed out in #4! No? Don't like it? Rinse and repeat. Sometimes we need a couple of drafts before we hit the nail on the head.
6.	⁠Look at all those lovely you-and-your-hubby specific words and sentences you've flushed out after x attempts! Now you have words you like, and way too many of them. Now is the time to start worrying about your word count. Circle your favorite images and words. Have an honest friend do the same.  Start thinking about which images can be taken out, what's redundant, etc. Sure, the nacho cheese moment at the fair was special, but maybe you don't actually want to discuss drying your nacho-crusted tank top under the bathroom air-dryers in front of all your loved ones on your wedding day. Scratch it out! You have pages of ideas to choose from.
7.	⁠Apply your lovely ideas to the template! Play around with the words/images/phrases you've circled. Keep your sentences simple and your words sharp. At this point the challenge is no longer writing; now you are completing a puzzle. Which words work best? Maybe a sentence you crossed off actually fits better than you previously thought, if you smash it up with that sentence you wrote four bullet points below. Good thing you didn't delete it. Because you've already done the heavy lifting (or heavy writing), this part may actually be kind-of fun! Fill in a couple templates with different options, see what you like best!

Note: Never delete anything permanently! You may find it useful later. Keep all relevant words/images/sentences until the vows are done and the wedding is over.

Good luck, I'm sure you'll do great!
