When passing information to your groomsmen, make sure to cover the following points:
1. Wedding date and location
2. Attire requirements (e.g. tuxedo, suit, specific color)
3. Grooming expectations (e.g. trimmed facial hair, hairstyle)
4. Rehearsal dinner details (date, time, location, attire)
5. Transportation arrangements for the wedding day
6. Gift expectations (if any)
7. Responsibilities during the wedding ceremony (e.g. standing at the altar, carrying the rings)
8. Contact information for you, the wedding planner or anyone else they may need to reach.
It's a good idea to have a clear and open line of communication with your groomsmen to ensure everyone is on the same page and that the wedding day runs smoothly.
