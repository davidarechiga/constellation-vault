To Whom It May Concern,

My name is David Arechiga and I am interested in working at the recently announced Brooklyn Apple Store. Currently, I am a genius at the SoHo location and have worked here for 18 months. Before working in Soho, I worked at Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, California for close to 4 years and Victoria Gardens in Rancho Cucamonga, California for close to 4 years. Since starting with Apple, I have gone though the roles of Specialist, Backstage Specialist, Technical Specialist and Genius. I also participated in a Genius Admin experience in my last 6 months at Third Street Promenade. I have gone through 2 NSO remodels. Two of my 3 genius teams have won Ovation Awards for Most Improved NPS. Over my 9 and a half years at Apple, I have been able to keep a consistently high NPS by engaging customers and making sure all of their needs are met with proper solutions.
