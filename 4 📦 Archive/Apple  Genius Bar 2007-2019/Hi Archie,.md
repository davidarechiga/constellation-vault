Hi Archie,

Before our next connection, I would love for you to reflect back on your lead experience. I would love to see a final recap highlighting your key achievements during your experience. Some things to think about -







What feedback did you receive?




I received feedback at the beginning of my lead experience to have a more zoomed out approach to supporting my team. In the first couple weeks of my experience, I faced a plethora of challenging customer service conversations around wait time and Genius Bar availability.

Using this wider perspective,




What were your biggest learns?










Anything you would do differently?







How will you take what you learned and apply it to your current role?
