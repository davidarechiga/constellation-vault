# Hi Gabby, Good Morning!
How’s are you? We are home from Bali! I hope everything went well with River and Hermes.
We were thinking of coming over at around 12pm. Are you still wanting to do the pumpkin patch? I have a show around 7pm so we would have to be out by 4-5pm.

Also, how much of the food is left? Do I need another bag?
