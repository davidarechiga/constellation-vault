For each achievement listed, please describe how you accomplished the achievement and the impact it had on your team and/or MasterClass. *(2-3 sentences max per achievement)*

### Achievement #1: Restructuring of MC Computer Replacement Process

Over the last 6 months, I developed the new computer replacement process to create a consistent and effortless experience for MasterClass employees. This process included improving the accuracy of asset organization, building text expander snippets for uniform communication across the Helpdesk team, and composing thorough documentation throughout the entire asset lifecycle. Streamlining this process has directly impacted all departments by decreasing computer replacement turnaround times, simplifying the data transfer process, and creating an overall positive experience when MasterClass computers break.

### **Achievement #2: Completed MasterClass Computer Check-in Project**

From early April 2022 to late June 2022, I completed the JAMF Device Check-In Project which included updating/maintaining accurate asset records (1 device per active employee), uncovering JAMF check-in issues via data analysis, and resolving them by expeditiously reaching out to affected users. Completion of this project gave System Administrators increased visibility to what computers were not updated and they were able to use Nudge to remind users to update, reducing our security vulnerabilities. IT was also able to swiftly wipe and remove MasterClass data from devices gifted in the 2022 Reduction In Force, lessening the potential for data leaks.

## **[OPTIONAL] Share 1-2 development opportunities from the past 6 months for you to improve further in your role.**
For each development opportunity, please provide an example of the development opportunity in action and share the potential impact. *(2-3 sentences max per development opportunity)*

**Development Opportunity for Improvement #1:** Presentation Skills

An area of opportunity I have discovered is my public speaking and ability to give presentations. I recently started assisting Gabby with New Hire Onboarding which includes delivering the IT + U Presentation. After giving a mock presentation, I received Feedback that I was low energy, nervous and stiff. Until I develop my presentation skills, there is a single point of failure as only one Helpdesk Technician is able to give the presentation. If that one technician is sick, there might not be someone to give the presentation. 

**Development Opportunity for Improvement #2:** Working with Senior Level Staff

Another development opportunity I have is working up the confidence to respond with firm deadlines when working with senior-level staff. I sometimes feel bothersome when in reality I have important deadlines that need to be meant. The potential impact is that SLAs will be breached, resulting in extra time being spent unnecessarily.

**Presentation Notes:**
Meet the IT Team: Do we really walk through every team member?
- We should move Yvette down to the System Admin Area
MC Data Privacy - Rough, unsure, practice more
		We talk about MasterClassIT, but seems unneeded
		- Also let’s not bring up PC
Security Tips -
- What’s 1Password? Start there, then talk about why to use it
		I like the personal touch
		- Even if you are around the home, even if you around the home - You repeated that example

-Kinda sounds like you are encouraging people to bring software to MasterClass. Maybe the word is as if there are any new applications that your team wants to bring on, make sure it goes through legal/security review
		don’t say celebrities, say, instructors
		- This carry on… got to change voice
-Don’t just read the quote, add context first “I like to remind users of XXX”
Ticket Demo -
-world best resolution, not great for “old” people
		You don’t need to list request types
Ticket Recap -
-Give an example of bad business justification (SHAME THEM)
Mobile Onboarding -
		Remind them quickly about what MasterClass IT is
System Access Non-MC Devices -
		I feel like we should just tighten this slide as a whole
1Password
		Maybe don’t bring up the pay for after leaving
1Password Setup
		Best slide, sounded good
