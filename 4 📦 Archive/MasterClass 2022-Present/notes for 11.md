Sony Sharma Ticket
https://masterclass.freshservice.com/a/tickets/3333?current_tab=details

Sony was sent a Contractor Onboarding email but was unable to sign in. She stated it asked for a verification code but I wasn’t sure what she meant. I attempted to resend the email to restart the sign-in process but it was never sent because I failed to approve the Zap. Once I realized this, I reached out and found out she was trying to sign into MasterClass systems with her Gmail email. After figuring this out. I directed her to sign in with her MasterClass email and the password that was sent to her and she was able to sign in. Once she signed in and got setup, I reminded her of the Acknowledgment Form. She had an issue seeing the form so I directed her to view the form using her MasterClass account and she was able to sign.
