Hi ,
After looking at your request and the computer’s history, we have determined it is time to replace your computer. Before we send out the computer, we have a few questions/requests:
1. Is the listed address still a good address and will you be available for the next 1-2 weeks to receive the computer? The package will require a signature upon delivery.
2. It is important to make sure you have your 1Password Recovery Kit saved to Google Drive so you can sign back into 1Password.
3. Please make sure to back up all your data in Google Drive. Backing up will make it easy to move over to your new device. <a href="https://masterclass-dev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IT/pages/1894187380/Google+Drive+-+How+to+Back+Up+and+Use+Google+Drive" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><u>Here is an article to help with this process</u></a>.
4. Once the computer is received, we expect the old computer to be shipped back within seven days of receiving it. We will be right there to support you to make this happen.
Please acknowledge all the points above and let us know if you have any questions or concerns about the process.
