# Zach’s Recommendation

I never knew what having an effective and compassionate manager meant until I became Zach’s direct report. 



As Zach’s direct report at MasterClass, I felt like I cared as an employee and human





Zach Schmidt is a fantastic manager and colleague. Zach made coming to work very easy because of his upbeat and friendly personality. Zach supported my growth by pushing me far enough out of my comfort zone that I felt like I was taking risks and learning from my mistakes quickly.  Zach had a sense of clarity and direction I have never seen before in IT. We implemented a new IT Service Management system together and I was always impressed with the level of detail he put into every project he managed. Zach is an effective communicator and I always knew what was expected of me.
