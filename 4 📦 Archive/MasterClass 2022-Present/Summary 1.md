## Summary
We are still in the process of gathering the most up-to-date information regarding the onboarding process from both the IT and PeopleOps processes.
## What we've accomplished
<b><u>Key Advancements</u></b>
- Documentation:
	- The first draft of the Process flowchart is close to completion with the second and third drafts to be completed by Mid next week (EOD Feb 1st). This is helping us define the Who, What, When, Where, and How of the MC Onboarding Process.
	- Asana vs FreshService comparison has been developed further with Asana POC in its beginning stages.
## What's blocked
As tickets come in and days get busy, it can be tough to find time to focus on the next steps. Aside from this, there are no blockers that I can see currently.
## Next steps
1. Generate a Task-based project in order to automatically update the progress based on Task completion.
2. <a href="https://asana.com/resources/raci-chart" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><u>Possibly develop RACI chart to help determine key stakeholders</u></a>
3. Complete the Pros & Cons list of Asana vs FreshService for Onboarding and get input from the internal team.
4. Continue looking for gaps in communication and pitfalls that can be avoided via Slack, email, and other communication channels.
5. Schedule a meeting with Zach to go over the information and generate questions for the People Ops / IT Meeting on 02/02/2023
6. Meet with People Ops to present our findings so they can fill in any gaps in our documentation.
