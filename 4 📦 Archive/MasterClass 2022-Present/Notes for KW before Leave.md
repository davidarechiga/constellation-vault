# Notes for KW before Leave

Recap of long standing tickets:

## **Printer Replacement Ticket**
[Ticket link](https://masterclass.freshservice.com/a/tickets/7201?current_tab=details)
- From what I can tell, this is not a pressing issue. 
- Currently we have a quote for printer inks but are possibly thinking of a new printer
- I think this can wait till you get back as we need cost approval

Update: Going with Inks to resolve issue. Get updated quote from Andrew and place order.
