OKR Update


**write me an okr that unifies communication for IT and PeopleOps under one tool**


Objective:
To unify communication for IT and PeopleOps teams under one tool, in order to improve collaboration and increase efficiency.
Key Results:
1. Implement a unified communication tool that meets the requirements of both IT and PeopleOps teams by the end of Q2.
2. Achieve a 90% adoption rate of the new communication tool by both IT and PeopleOps teams by the end of Q3.
3. Conduct a survey to assess user satisfaction with the new communication tool, achieving a score of at least 8 out of 10, by the end of Q4.
4. Reduce the number of redundant communication channels by 50% by the end of Q4, by migrating all relevant communications to the new unified tool.
5. Increase the speed of response to internal inquiries by 30% by the end of Q4, by using the new unified communication tool to improve collaboration between IT and PeopleOps teams.

**keep a realistic plan for q2**


Sure, here's an updated Objective with a realistic plan for Q2:
Objective:
To unify communication for IT and PeopleOps teams under one tool, in order to improve collaboration, reduce errors, and increase efficiency.
Key Results:
1. Research and identify a communication tool that meets the requirements of both IT and PeopleOps teams by the end of Q1.
2. Obtain approval from all necessary stakeholders for the selected communication tool by the end of Q1.
3. Begin the implementation process of the new communication tool by the end of Q1.
4. Complete the initial setup and configuration of the new communication tool by the end of Q2.
5. Conduct training sessions for all IT and PeopleOps team members on how to use the new communication tool by the end of Q2.
Note: The above plan assumes that the organization has a moderate to large size, and the implementation process may take longer than anticipated depending on the complexity of the communication tool and the number of users who need to be trained.

**people ops and IT make up about 20 people supporting about 500**


Thank you for the clarification. Here's an updated Objective and Key Results that take into account the smaller size of the IT and PeopleOps teams and the number of users they support:

7. Reduce errors caused by miscommunications between IT and PeopleOps teams by 10% by the end of Q4, by using the new unified communication tool to improve collaboration and ensure clear and accurate communication.
8. Reduce the time spent on communication tasks by 20% by the end of Q4, by using the new unified communication tool to streamline communication processes and reduce duplication.
9. Increase the speed of response to internal inquiries by 15% by the end of Q4, by using the new unified communication tool to improve collaboration between IT and PeopleOps teams.
Note: The above plan assumes that the organization has a moderate to low complexity level, and the implementation process may take shorter than anticipated.
