# Yvette’s Review

Projects we worked on:
- Wifi Testing in SFO
	- Who: **Yvette, Myself, Gabby and a vendor**
	- What: **We worked on resolving network connectivity issues and also optimized our wireless network in the San Francisco office.**
	- Where: **Virtual Collaboration as well as the SFO OFFICE**
	- Why: **Reports of inconsistent internet connectivity from multiple uers**
	- How: **After determining the scope of the issues, Yvette developed a plan to:**
		- **identify the problem (inconsistent wireless connectivity in SFO)**
		- **Establish a theory of probable cause (2.4GHz and 5GHZ attenas were clashing)**
		- **Test the theory to determine the cause (test wireless before and after disabling 2.4GHz wireless antennae)**
		- **Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution (Have a wirless site-survey run, confirming theories, change meraki settings and test functionality of SFO Wireless network)**
		- **Verify full system functionality, and, if applicable, implement preventive measures**
		- **Document findings, actions and outcomes**
	- How Yvette excels:
		- **Yvette has a very methodical and comforting approach to solving problems. Having worked on this incident with her, I found her to be approachable and communicative throughout every step of the process (communication at the start, throughout the process and at the end as we marked it as resolved.) She has a beautiful way to keeping everything moving while not making things feel rushed.**

# AIM H2 2023 TEAMMATE REVIEW QUESTIONS

## <b><u>Achievements</u></b>
1. Reflecting across project(s), program(s), initiative(s) or task(s) over the past 12 months, please share your observations regarding your teammate’s achievements. **What aspects did they excel in?** *Please provide specific examples of quality, scope, and/or timeliness.*

*—————————————————* 

In December of 2022, We received reports of faulty wireless internet connection in the San Francisco Office. Within 5 minutes of being notified, Yvette has acknowledged my message along with her next steps. She promptly found inconsistencies in the network and started testing fixes which temporarily resolved the issue while she was gathering more information.

The next day, we started getting more reports of internet issues and again, once notified, Yvette was quick to respond, this time within 2 minutes of receiving my message. After many messages, back and forth, we determined that this issue was more widespread then we initially thought but Yvette did not wavier.

Within the next 3 weeks, Yvette had a thorough plan to resolve the SFO Internet issue:
1. identify the problem (inconsistent wireless connectivity in SFO)
2. Establish a theory of probable cause (2.4GHz and 5GHZ antennae were clashing)
3. Test the theory to determine the cause (test wireless before and after disabling 2.4GHz wireless antennae)
4. Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution (Have a wireless site-survey run, confirming theories, modify Meraki settings and test functionality of SFO Wireless network)

Over the next month, I worked with Yvette, Gabby and Sycomp to run a wireless site survey and test connectivity before and after our planned fixes. I enjoyed how Yvette clearly communicated her intention with every step of the incident remediation, checked in with users to make sure they were kept in the loop, and saw the project through in what I thought was a timely manner.

1. Thinking about the same project(s), program(s), initiative(s) or task(s) **where do you believe there is room for improvement?** *Please provide specific examples of quality, scope, and/or timeliness.*
2. Thinking about the same project(s), program(s), initiative(s) or task(s) i**n what ways did your teammate’s contributions to this project(s) enable others to move forward and/or impact other work streams?** *Please provide specific examples of quality, scope, and/or timeliness.*

*—————————————————* 

The impact of this remediation was that users in the SF office were no longer interrupted by internet connectivity issues. Internet is at the heart of the work being done at MasterClass as we are a cloud-first company.
