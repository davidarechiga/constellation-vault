Chat with Kevin:

What I am going to work on:

- **Dynamically changing due dates based on New hire start date or other aspects like delays**
	- This important because it will allow us to be agile when dates change or tasks get delayed without create much more manual work for People Ops and IT. This is a crucial element for the team to stay on track.
	- Looking for the flexability to adjust as needed.
	- Dates change from time to time.


- &nbsp;
	- **What I have found:**

- **Communicate with users outside of Asana FreshService. Users include New Hire Personal emails, Managers, Recruiters, Contracting Companies, etc. Automating Ticket Creation for approvals**
	- Uses cases for this include Manager Approval for Software Access requests, Pre-Onboarding Communication with New Hire/Manager.
	- This is important because these types of communications are often spread across different channels like email, slack, tickets. These are not always visible to all parties. Because of this, historical context is hard to find.
	- Thinking about the scenarios:
		- Are we engaging with outside people?
		- Brain storm ideas for communicating with people outside of agents (Before new hire starts, etc.)


- &nbsp;
	- **What I have found:**
		- commincating with New Hire before systems access is granted
			- this includes laptop delivery
		- Date changes / delays (commincating with Recruiters)
		- Expedited Onboarding approvals
		- Possibly Offboarding Communication

- **Options for using variables for names in FreshService so they can be replaced through the process of project creation**
	- This removes a massive amount of manual work for IT and People Ops as there will be many pieces of information copy and pasted through out the projects and tickets.
	- biggest focus is to do this native with FreshService
	- It’s important to have the name and email in each task for visibility standpoint
