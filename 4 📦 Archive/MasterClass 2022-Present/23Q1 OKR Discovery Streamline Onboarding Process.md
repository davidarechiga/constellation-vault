# 23Q1 OKR **[Discovery] Streamline Onboarding Process**
We chatted via Slack, but let’s focus on these in the next few days 
- Go through slack history to check for communication gaps/application workflow breakdowns
	- Blank Fields in BambooHR
	- Not enough licenses for OneLogin
	- shipping exceptions - wrong addresses
	- misspellings
	- rehires
	- incorrect start date/effective dates

- Start drafting a trimmed-down lucid chart/[draw.io](http://draw.io) of just the core systems and timelines it takes to onboard a user.
	- inventory of current tech systems involved
		- Greenhouse

	- develop the who, what, when, where, and how of onboarding
		- Who:

- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ai0v-RO4sw633-e0NxS_IDHwYPnYFXJLNH5l8YFOwCo/edit#heading=h.krojonejiaxy - Review this document to get a better understanding
- Read about onboarding in Asana and start generating a pros and cons list between FS and Asana
	- Arvig and Asana New Hire Onboarding

I took a look at the document that Shira shared over, I think both of you can value from that in your reflective OKR and onboarding. Here are some take aways that I think we can learn from

		"It would also be helpful to have a resource page to understand what each of the systems do and what the use case for them are."
		*We should review the Company tools page here soon. It got killed because of what Kim was working on but it seems that won't come to light.*
		- "Software requests & access for engineering is unclear, since it is a mix of IT requests and requesting access via specific slack channels, but this is more of a ownership issue amongst the eng org.
		*(Probably a real long term solve that will likely come soon enough)*
		- Loved how easy IT was.
		- So much to take in
		- LOVE THE OFFICE HOURS
		*It's clear we can't get rid of office hours.*
		- I think if I had just been told, "Hey, it'll take a bit to get all your permissions set up, etc. Don't worry! That's totally normal and if you feel like you've got nothing to do and are waiting around, enjoy it!" I would have probably felt a little less anxious in the beginning.
		- I think Mel basically echo'd this thought as well
