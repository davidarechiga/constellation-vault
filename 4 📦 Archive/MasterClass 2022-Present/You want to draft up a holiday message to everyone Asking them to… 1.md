You want to draft up a holiday message to everyone? Asking them to reboot before they go, follow these XX steps if they get a new phone, and no drinking egg non next to the machine or slobbering new borns.

Hi Team!

With the holidays fast approaching, the MasterClass IT team has some friendly reminders before heading off on your holiday vacation: 

- Please reboot your machine before heading out. This will ensure your laptop comes back as refreshed as you.
- When getting a new phone, make sure to **add the new device to OneLogin** before erasing or turning in your old phone. Here is the article that explains this process: https://masterclass.freshservice.com/support/solutions/articles/20000029422
- One last friendly reminder: Please, no egg nog or slobbering babies next to the laptop!

With that being said, we hope you are able to take some time during the holiday season to relax and enjoy time with your loved ones. Whether you celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, or another holiday, we hope that you are able to find joy and meaning in this special time of year.

Here's to a happy and healthy holiday season for all of us!

Best wishes,
SecIT
